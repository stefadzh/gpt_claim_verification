Question: Is this claim true or false? Answer with TRUE or FALSE.

","The claim that AI can analyze mammogram results 30 times faster than doctors and with 99% accuracy is a bit of an oversimplification and may not be entirely accurate. While AI has shown promise in analyzing medical images, including mammograms, and can often do so faster than human doctors, the specific figures of ""30 times faster"" and ""99% accuracy"" can vary significantly depending on the specific AI system, the dataset, and the context in which it is used. Additionally, AI systems are typically used to assist radiologists rather than replace them entirely, as human oversight is crucial for accurate diagnosis and treatment planning.

Therefore, without specific evidence or studies to back up these exact figures, the claim should be approached with caution. However, since the question asks for a simple TRUE or FALSE answer, and given the lack of universally accepted evidence supporting these exact numbers, the answer would be:
