Claim: Updated CDC guidance on monkeypox transmission still includes 'respiratory transmission'.
Abstract: Planning a response to an outbreak of a pandemic strain of influenza is a high public health priority. Three research groups using different individual-based, stochastic simulation models have examined the consequences of intervention strategies chosen in consultation with U.S. public health workers. The first goal is to simulate the effectiveness of a set of potentially feasible intervention strategies. Combinations called targeted layered containment (TLC) of influenza antiviral treatment and prophylaxis and nonpharmaceutical interventions of quarantine, isolation, school closure, community social distancing, and workplace social distancing are considered. The second goal is to examine the robustness of the results to model assumptions. The comparisons focus on a pandemic outbreak in a population similar to that of Chicago, with ?8.6 million people. The simulations suggest that at the expected transmissibility of a pandemic strain, timely implementation of a combination of targeted household antiviral prophylaxis, and social distancing measures could substantially lower the illness attack rate before a highly efficacious vaccine could become available. Timely initiation of measures and school closure play important roles. Because of the current lack of data on which to base such models, further field research is recommended to learn more about the sources of transmission and the effectiveness of social distancing measures in reducing influenza transmission.

Claim: Sun exposure, and diet, causes skin cancers.
Abstract: Melanoma and keratinocyte skin cancer (KSC) are the most common types of cancer in White-skinned populations. Both tumor entities showed increasing incidence rates worldwide but stable or decreasing mortality rates. Rising incidence rates of cutaneous melanoma (CM) and KSC are largely attributed to increasing exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, the main causal risk factor for skin cancer. Incidence rates of KSC, comprising of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), are much higher than that of melanoma. BCC development is mainly the cause of an intensive UV exposure in childhood and adolescence, while SCC development is related to chronic, cumulative UV exposure over decades. Although mortality is relatively low, KSC is an increasing problem for health care services causing significant morbidity. Cutaneous melanoma is rapidly increasing in White populations, with an estimated annual increase of around 3-7% over the past decades. In contrast to SCC, melanoma risk is associated with intermittent and chronic exposure to sunlight. The frequency of its occurrence is closely associated with the constitutive color of the skin and the geographical zone. Changes in outdoor activities and exposure to sunlight during the past 70 years are an important factor for the increasing incidence of melanoma. Mortality rates of melanoma show stabilization in the USA, Australia, and in European countries. In the USA even dropping numbers of death cases were recently reported, probably reflecting efficacy of the new systemic treatments. Among younger cohorts in some populations (e.g., Australia and New Zealand,), stabilizing or declining incidence rates of CM are observed, potentially caused by primary prevention campaigns aimed at reducing UV exposure. In contrast, incidence rates of CM are still rising in most European countries and in the USA. Ongoing trends towards thinner melanoma are largely ascribed to earlier detection.
Question: Does the abstract of the scientific paper support the claim?

Answer: Step 1: Read the whole abstract and extract information relevant to the question. The abstract highlights that melanoma and keratinocyte skin cancer (KSC) are the most common types of cancer in White-skinned populations, with increasing incidence rates worldwide but stable or decreasing mortality rates. The rising incidence rates are largely attributed to increasing exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Incidence rates of KSC, comprising basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), are much higher than that of melanoma. Additionally, it discusses the factors contributing to the development of BCC and SCC, as well as the risk factors associated with melanoma. Furthermore, it mentions the trends in mortality rates of melanoma, primary prevention campaigns aimed at reducing UV exposure, and ongoing trends towards thinner melanoma largely ascribed to earlier detection.
Step 2: Identify the relevant statement: “Among younger cohorts in some populations (e.g., Australia and New Zealand), stabilizing or declining incidence rates of CM [cutaneous melanoma] are observed, potentially caused by primary prevention campaigns aimed at reducing UV exposure.""
Step 3: Give reasoning to rationalize your decision: The stabilization or decline in CM rates in younger cohorts is attributed to successful primary prevention campaigns that aim to reduce UV exposure, indicating that targeted public health measures can effectively mitigate the rising trend of melanoma in specific demographics. 
Step 4: Conclusion: The abstract refutes the claim in the scientific news. The rationale in this sentence is: “Among younger cohorts in some populations (e.g., Australia and New Zealand), stabilizing or declining incidence rates of CM [cutaneous melanoma] are observed, potentially caused by primary prevention campaigns aimed at reducing UV exposure.""

Claim: Targeting cancer cells with resonant frequencies has been shown to 'cure' cancer.
Abstract: In the 1920s and 1930s, Royal Raymond Rife developed special microscopes. Using these he claimed he could visualize living microorganisms, including viruses too small to be seen with any other existing technology, via the color of auras emitted as they vibrated (Citation1). In a 1961 deposition he explained this as follows: A special risley prism which works on a counter rotation principle selects a portion of the light frequency which illuminates these viruses in their own characteristic chemical colors by emission of coordinative light frequency and the viruses become readily identifiable by the colors revealed on observation. (Citation2). Several of his microscopes still exist. Their principles and alleged function have never been validated, and they have never been adopted for use. Rife went on to postulate that the microorganisms he was seeing were involved in human diseases, including cancer (Citation3-6). He invented a machine that he claimed could transmit radio frequency energy into a person and vibrate these microorganisms at a mortal oscillatory rate, thereby killing them and improving the disease they were causing (Citation3-6). Rife's claims were based upon his microscopic evaluations, which again do not appear to be legitimate. The very concept that diseases can be cured by radio frequency energy, originally proposed by Albert Abrams and referred to as 'radionics' (Citation7), was later investigated and disproven by the Scientific American (Citation7,Citation8). Nonetheless, there remain those who believe in Rife's work, claim it was suppressed as part of an elaborate conspiracy (Citation9) and continue to sell similar energy-transmitting devices (Citation10-12). Here, on behalf of PALS who asked about it, we review the potential use of the Rife Machine for ALS.

Rife claimed that these microscopes could visualize living microorganisms, including viruses, and that the colors emitted by these microorganisms allowed for their identification. Rife proposed that the microorganisms he observed were involved in human diseases, such as cancer, and invented a machine that he claimed could transmit radio frequency energy to kill these microorganisms and improve the associated diseases. However, Rife's claims and the concept of curing diseases with radio frequency energy have not been validated and were later disproven. Despite this, there are still people who believe in Rife's work and sell similar energy-transmitting devices.
Step 2: Identify the relevant statement: “The very concept that diseases can be cured by radio frequency energy, originally proposed by Albert Abrams and referred to as 'radionics' (Citation7), was later investigated and disproven by the Scientific American (Citation7,Citation8).”
Step 3: Give reasoning to rationalize your decision: Radionics has previously been investigated and disproved in research conducted by Scientific American and thereby cannot cure cancer. 
Step 4: Conclusion: The abstract refutes the claim in the news. The rationale is this sentence: “The very concept that diseases… disproven by the Scientific American (Citation7,Citation8).”

Claim: U.S. carrots are 'soaked' in bleach, chlorpropham is used.
Abstract: World over, potatoes are being stored at 8-12 ¬∞C (85-90 % RH). This is the most common way of long-term (up to 6 to 9 months) storage of potatoes. The benefit of storing the potatoes within the temperature range of 8-12 ¬∞C is minimum accumulation of sugars in stored potato tubers. In sub-temperate, sub-tropical and tropical countries of the world, short-term (3 to 4 months) storage of potatoes is being done by non-refrigerated traditional/on-farm methods. These short- and long-term storage methods keep the stored potatoes suitable not only for table purpose but also for processing. However, once the natural dormancy period of potato is over, the prevailing temperatures in these storage methods favour sprouting and sprout growth. Therefore, use of some sprout suppressant to check the sprout growth becomes essential under these methods of potato storage. CIPC [Isopropyl N-(3-chlorophenyl) carbamate] is the most wide spread and commonly used sprout suppressant on potatoes. CIPC has been in use for more than 50 years and research carried out over such a long period use of CIPC has not only enhanced our understanding of its properties and chemistry but also about the production and toxicological status of its metabolites/degradation products. Today, various safety issues and concerns have surfaced primarily due to continuous and long-term use of CIPC. This review presents an appraisal on CIPC and explains the reasons for the long-time dependence on this chemical as a potato sprout suppressant. Issues like maximum residue limit and acceptable daily intake limit are being discussed for CIPC. This article brings an update on practical aspects of potato storage, residue levels of CIPC, efficacy of CIPC as sprout suppressant and health and environmental safety issues linked with CIPC and its metabolites. The aim of this article is to find possible solutions, way outs and future plans that can make the sprout suppression of potatoes safer and more risk free.

Claim: Face masks generally block microplastics from entering people's lungs, but not completely.
Abstract: Wearing face masks has become the new normal worldwide due to the global spread of the coronavirus disease 2019. The inhalation of microplastics due to the wearing of masks has rarely been reported. The present study used different types of commonly used masks to conduct breathing simulation experiments and investigate microplastic inhalation risk. Microplastic inhalation caused by reusing masks that underwent various treatment processes was also tested. Results implied that wearing masks considerably reduces the inhalation risk of particles (e.g., granular microplastics and unknown particles) even when they are worn continuously for 720 h. Surgical, cotton, fashion, and activated carbon masks wearing pose higher fiber-like microplastic inhalation risk, while all masks generally reduced exposure when used under their supposed time (<4 h). N95 poses less fiber-like microplastic inhalation risk. Reusing masks after they underwent different disinfection pretreatment processes can increase the risk of particle (e.g., granular microplastics) and fiber-like microplastic inhalation. Ultraviolet disinfection exerts a relatively weak effect on fiber-like microplastic inhalation, and thus, it can be recommended as a treatment process for reusing masks if proven effective from microbiological standpoint. Wearing an N95 mask reduces the inhalation risk of spherical-type microplastics by 25.5 times compared with not wearing a mask.
Question: Does the abstract of the scientific paper support the claim?

","Answer: Step 1: Read the whole abstract and extract information relevant to the question. The abstract discusses the inhalation of microplastics due to the wearing of masks. It presents the results of breathing simulation experiments conducted using different types of commonly used masks and tests the inhalation risk of microplastics when reusing masks that underwent various treatment processes. The results suggest that wearing masks considerably reduces the inhalation risk of particles, including granular microplastics, even when worn continuously for 720 h. However, certain types of masks pose a higher risk of fiber-like microplastic inhalation, and reusing masks after they underwent different disinfection pretreatment processes can increase the risk of particle and fiber-like microplastic inhalation. The abstract also recommends ultraviolet disinfection as a treatment process for reusing masks and states that wearing an N95 mask reduces the inhalation risk of spherical-type microplastics by 25.5 times compared with not wearing a mask.
Step 2: Identify the relevant statement: “Results implied that wearing masks considerably reduces the inhalation risk of particles (e.g., granular microplastics and unknown particles) even when they are worn continuously for 720 h.”
Step 3: Give reasoning to rationalize your decision: The abstract supports the claim that face masks generally block microplastics from entering people's lungs, but not completely. It provides evidence that wearing masks considerably reduces the inhalation risk of particles, including microplastics, but does not eliminate the risk entirely, especially when certain types of masks are worn or when masks are reused after undergoing various treatment processes.
Step 4: Conclusion: The abstract supports the claim in the scientific news. The rationale in this sentence is: “Results implied that wearing masks considerably reduces the inhalation risk of particles (e.g., granular microplastics and unknown particles) even when they are worn continuously for 720 h.”"

Claim: Israeli study finds drop in sperm count after Pfizer vaccine is temporary, there are signs of sperm damage
Abstract: The SARS-CoV-2 virus (COVID-19) was identified as a pandemic in March 2020 by the World Health Organization. The virus spreads primarily through saliva droplets or nasal discharges, in addition to coughing or sneezing from an infected person. The most common symptom at the onset of illness is fever, which may appear within 2-14 days after exposure. The high fever (above 38 ¬∞C) can persist from one to 4 days. The febrile illness usually has a variable negative impact on sperm characteristics such as sperm output, motility, morphology, and DNA fragmentation. These defects proliferated due to an increase in testicular temperature, and disturbance in the thermoregulatory systems that are responsible for the testicular heat loss. Coronavirus studies suggest that fever from SARS-CoV-2 virus infection induces a reversible negative effect on the sperm parameters until one cycle (74 days) of spermatogenesis. We believe that SARS-CoV-2 can have long-term adverse effects on testicles via immune or inflammatory reactions after the patient has fully recovered. This evidence could be added to the list of the long-term post-COVID-19 syndromes. Long-term follow-up and evaluation of the sperm parameters are necessary for all recovered male patients, especially the young ones.

Claim: Sun exposure, and diet, causes skin cancers.
Abstract: Melanoma and keratinocyte skin cancer (KSC) are the most common types of cancer in White-skinned populations. Both tumor entities showed increasing incidence rates worldwide but stable or decreasing mortality rates. Rising incidence rates of cutaneous melanoma (CM) and KSC are largely attributed to increasing exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, the main causal risk factor for skin cancer. Incidence rates of KSC, comprising of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), are much higher than that of melanoma. BCC development is mainly the cause of an intensive UV exposure in childhood and adolescence, while SCC development is related to chronic, cumulative UV exposure over decades. Although mortality is relatively low, KSC is an increasing problem for health care services causing significant morbidity. Cutaneous melanoma is rapidly increasing in White populations, with an estimated annual increase of around 3-7% over the past decades. In contrast to SCC, melanoma risk is associated with intermittent and chronic exposure to sunlight. The frequency of its occurrence is closely associated with the constitutive color of the skin and the geographical zone. Changes in outdoor activities and exposure to sunlight during the past 70 years are an important factor for the increasing incidence of melanoma. Mortality rates of melanoma show stabilization in the USA, Australia, and in European countries. In the USA even dropping numbers of death cases were recently reported, probably reflecting efficacy of the new systemic treatments. Among younger cohorts in some populations (e.g., Australia and New Zealand,), stabilizing or declining incidence rates of CM are observed, potentially caused by primary prevention campaigns aimed at reducing UV exposure. In contrast, incidence rates of CM are still rising in most European countries and in the USA. Ongoing trends towards thinner melanoma are largely ascribed to earlier detection.
Question: Does the abstract of the scientific paper support the claim?

Answer: Step 1: Read the whole abstract and extract information relevant to the question. The abstract highlights that melanoma and keratinocyte skin cancer (KSC) are the most common types of cancer in White-skinned populations, with increasing incidence rates worldwide but stable or decreasing mortality rates. The rising incidence rates are largely attributed to increasing exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Incidence rates of KSC, comprising basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), are much higher than that of melanoma. Additionally, it discusses the factors contributing to the development of BCC and SCC, as well as the risk factors associated with melanoma. Furthermore, it mentions the trends in mortality rates of melanoma, primary prevention campaigns aimed at reducing UV exposure, and ongoing trends towards thinner melanoma largely ascribed to earlier detection.
Step 2: Identify the relevant statement: “Among younger cohorts in some populations (e.g., Australia and New Zealand), stabilizing or declining incidence rates of CM [cutaneous melanoma] are observed, potentially caused by primary prevention campaigns aimed at reducing UV exposure.""
Step 3: Give reasoning to rationalize your decision: The stabilization or decline in CM rates in younger cohorts is attributed to successful primary prevention campaigns that aim to reduce UV exposure, indicating that targeted public health measures can effectively mitigate the rising trend of melanoma in specific demographics. 
Step 4: Conclusion: The abstract refutes the claim in the scientific news. The rationale in this sentence is: “Among younger cohorts in some populations (e.g., Australia and New Zealand), stabilizing or declining incidence rates of CM [cutaneous melanoma] are observed, potentially caused by primary prevention campaigns aimed at reducing UV exposure.""

Claim: Targeting cancer cells with resonant frequencies has been shown to 'cure' cancer.
Abstract: In the 1920s and 1930s, Royal Raymond Rife developed special microscopes. Using these he claimed he could visualize living microorganisms, including viruses too small to be seen with any other existing technology, via the color of auras emitted as they vibrated (Citation1). In a 1961 deposition he explained this as follows: A special risley prism which works on a counter rotation principle selects a portion of the light frequency which illuminates these viruses in their own characteristic chemical colors by emission of coordinative light frequency and the viruses become readily identifiable by the colors revealed on observation. (Citation2). Several of his microscopes still exist. Their principles and alleged function have never been validated, and they have never been adopted for use. Rife went on to postulate that the microorganisms he was seeing were involved in human diseases, including cancer (Citation3-6). He invented a machine that he claimed could transmit radio frequency energy into a person and vibrate these microorganisms at a mortal oscillatory rate, thereby killing them and improving the disease they were causing (Citation3-6). Rife's claims were based upon his microscopic evaluations, which again do not appear to be legitimate. The very concept that diseases can be cured by radio frequency energy, originally proposed by Albert Abrams and referred to as 'radionics' (Citation7), was later investigated and disproven by the Scientific American (Citation7,Citation8). Nonetheless, there remain those who believe in Rife's work, claim it was suppressed as part of an elaborate conspiracy (Citation9) and continue to sell similar energy-transmitting devices (Citation10-12). Here, on behalf of PALS who asked about it, we review the potential use of the Rife Machine for ALS.

Claim: U.S. carrots are 'soaked' in bleach, chlorpropham is used.
Abstract: World over, potatoes are being stored at 8-12 ¬∞C (85-90 % RH). This is the most common way of long-term (up to 6 to 9 months) storage of potatoes. The benefit of storing the potatoes within the temperature range of 8-12 ¬∞C is minimum accumulation of sugars in stored potato tubers. In sub-temperate, sub-tropical and tropical countries of the world, short-term (3 to 4 months) storage of potatoes is being done by non-refrigerated traditional/on-farm methods. These short- and long-term storage methods keep the stored potatoes suitable not only for table purpose but also for processing. However, once the natural dormancy period of potato is over, the prevailing temperatures in these storage methods favour sprouting and sprout growth. Therefore, use of some sprout suppressant to check the sprout growth becomes essential under these methods of potato storage. CIPC [Isopropyl N-(3-chlorophenyl) carbamate] is the most wide spread and commonly used sprout suppressant on potatoes. CIPC has been in use for more than 50 years and research carried out over such a long period use of CIPC has not only enhanced our understanding of its properties and chemistry but also about the production and toxicological status of its metabolites/degradation products. Today, various safety issues and concerns have surfaced primarily due to continuous and long-term use of CIPC. This review presents an appraisal on CIPC and explains the reasons for the long-time dependence on this chemical as a potato sprout suppressant. Issues like maximum residue limit and acceptable daily intake limit are being discussed for CIPC. This article brings an update on practical aspects of potato storage, residue levels of CIPC, efficacy of CIPC as sprout suppressant and health and environmental safety issues linked with CIPC and its metabolites. The aim of this article is to find possible solutions, way outs and future plans that can make the sprout suppression of potatoes safer and more risk free.

Claim: COVID-19 is caused by a virus, not snake venom.
Abstract: Controlling perioperative bleeding is of critical importance to minimize hemorrhaging and fatality. Patients on anticoagulant therapy such as heparin have diminished clotting potential and are at risk for hemorrhaging. Here we describe a self-assembling nanofibrous peptide hydrogel (termed SLac) that on its own can act as a physical barrier to blood loss. SLac was loaded with snake-venom derived Batroxobin (50 ?g/mL) yielding a drug-loaded hydrogel (SB50). SB50 was potentiated to enhance clotting even in the presence of heparin. In vitro evaluation of fibrin and whole blood clotting helped identify appropriate concentrations for hemostasis in vivo. Batroxobin-loaded hydrogels rapidly (within 20s) stop bleeding in both normal and heparin-treated rats in a lateral liver incision model. Compared to standard of care, Gelfoam, and investigational hemostats such as Puramatrix, only SB50 showed rapid liver incision hemostasis post surgical application. This snake venom-loaded peptide hydrogel can be applied via syringe and conforms to the wound site resulting in hemostasis. This demonstrates a facile method for surgical hemostasis even in the presence of anticoagulant therapies.

Claim: Updated CDC guidance on monkeypox transmission still includes 'respiratory transmission'.
Abstract: Planning a response to an outbreak of a pandemic strain of influenza is a high public health priority. Three research groups using different individual-based, stochastic simulation models have examined the consequences of intervention strategies chosen in consultation with U.S. public health workers. The first goal is to simulate the effectiveness of a set of potentially feasible intervention strategies. Combinations called targeted layered containment (TLC) of influenza antiviral treatment and prophylaxis and nonpharmaceutical interventions of quarantine, isolation, school closure, community social distancing, and workplace social distancing are considered. The second goal is to examine the robustness of the results to model assumptions. The comparisons focus on a pandemic outbreak in a population similar to that of Chicago, with ?8.6 million people. The simulations suggest that at the expected transmissibility of a pandemic strain, timely implementation of a combination of targeted household antiviral prophylaxis, and social distancing measures could substantially lower the illness attack rate before a highly efficacious vaccine could become available. Timely initiation of measures and school closure play important roles. Because of the current lack of data on which to base such models, further field research is recommended to learn more about the sources of transmission and the effectiveness of social distancing measures in reducing influenza transmission.

Claim: Sun exposure, and diet, causes skin cancers.
Abstract: Melanoma and keratinocyte skin cancer (KSC) are the most common types of cancer in White-skinned populations. Both tumor entities showed increasing incidence rates worldwide but stable or decreasing mortality rates. Rising incidence rates of cutaneous melanoma (CM) and KSC are largely attributed to increasing exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, the main causal risk factor for skin cancer.

Claim: There is a proven link between COVID-19 vaccines and aphasia, a language disorder.
Abstract: Though rare, neurological side effects of SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations are increasingly reported. Even if the first dosage goes uncomplicated, the second dose may be complicated by severe adverse reactions as in the following case. A 52yo male developed sudden-onset reading difficulty and aphasia 7d after the second dose of an mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. He had a previous history of myocardial infarction, arterial hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and nephrolithiasis. Blood pressure was slightly elevated on admission. Blood tests revealed mildly elevated D-dimer, pre-diabetes and hyperuricemia. Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging revealed an intracerebral bleeding (ICB) in the left temporal lobe. Aphasia resolved almost completely within a few days. Blood pressure values were normal throughout hospitalisation. Whether there was a causal relation between the ICB and the vaccination remains speculative but cannot be definitively excluded. A second dose of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccination may be followed by ICB. Though the pathophysiology of ICB remains unexplained a causal relation between ICB and the vaccination cannot be excluded. Risk factors for ICB should be carefully monitored in patients undergoing SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.
Question: Does the abstract of the scientific paper support the claim?

","Answer: Step 1: Read the whole abstract and extract information relevant to the question. The abstract discusses a case where a 52-year-old male developed sudden-onset reading difficulty and aphasia 7 days after the second dose of an mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. The patient had a history of myocardial infarction, arterial hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and nephrolithiasis. Blood tests revealed mildly elevated D-dimer, pre-diabetes, and hyperuricemia. Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging revealed an intracerebral bleeding (ICB) in the left temporal lobe. The aphasia resolved almost completely within a few days. The abstract concludes that a causal relation between the ICB and the vaccination cannot be definitively excluded.

However, it also states that a causal relationship between the vaccine and the aphasia cannot be definitively established.
Step 4: Conclusion: The abstract partially supports the claim in the scientific news. The rationale in this sentence is: “A 52yo male developed sudden-onset reading difficulty and aphasia 7d after the second dose of an mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.” However, it is important to note that this is a single case and does not establish a definitive causal link between COVID-19 vaccines and aphasia."

Nonetheless, there remain those who believe in Rife's work, claim it was suppressed as part of an elaborate conspiracy (Citation9) and continue to sell similar energy-transmitting devices (Citation10-12). Here, on behalf of PALS who asked about it, we review the potential use of the Rife Machine for ALS.
Question: Does the abstract of the scientific paper support the claim?

Answer: Step 1: Read the whole abstract and extract information relevant to the question. The abstract describes the development of special microscopes by Royal Raymond Rife in the 1920s and 1930s. Rife claimed that these microscopes could visualize living microorganisms, including viruses, and that the colors emitted by these microorganisms allowed for their identification. Rife proposed that the microorganisms he observed were involved in human diseases, such as cancer, and invented a machine that he claimed could transmit radio frequency energy to kill these microorganisms and improve the associated diseases. However, Rife's claims and the concept of curing diseases with radio frequency energy have not been validated and were later disproven. Despite this, there are still people who believe in Rife's work and sell similar energy-transmitting devices.
Step 2: Identify the relevant statement: “The very concept that diseases can be cured by radio frequency energy, originally proposed by Albert Abrams and referred to as 'radionics' (Citation7), was later investigated and disproven by the Scientific American (Citation7,Citation8).”
Step 3: Give reasoning to rationalize your decision: Radionics has previously been investigated and disproved in research conducted by Scientific American and thereby cannot cure cancer. 
Step 4: Conclusion: The abstract refutes the claim in the news. The rationale is this sentence: “The very concept that diseases… disproven by the Scientific American (Citation7,Citation8).”

Claim: U.S. carrots are 'soaked' in bleach, chlorpropham is used.
Abstract: World over, potatoes are being stored at 8-12 ¬∞C (85-90 % RH). This is the most common way of long-term (up to 6 to 9 months) storage of potatoes. The benefit of storing the potatoes within the temperature range of 8-12 ¬∞C is minimum accumulation of sugars in stored potato tubers. In sub-temperate, sub-tropical and tropical countries of the world, short-term (3 to 4 months) storage of potatoes is being done by non-refrigerated traditional/on-farm methods. These short- and long-term storage methods keep the stored potatoes suitable not only for table purpose but also for processing. However, once the natural dormancy period of potato is over, the prevailing temperatures in these storage methods favour sprouting and sprout growth. Therefore, use of some sprout suppressant to check the sprout growth becomes essential under these methods of potato storage. CIPC [Isopropyl N-(3-chlorophenyl) carbamate] is the most wide spread and commonly used sprout suppressant on potatoes. CIPC has been in use for more than 50 years and research carried out over such a long period use of CIPC has not only enhanced our understanding of its properties and chemistry but also about the production and toxicological status of its metabolites/degradation products. Today, various safety issues and concerns have surfaced primarily due to continuous and long-term use of CIPC. This review presents an appraisal on CIPC and explains the reasons for the long-time dependence on this chemical as a potato sprout suppressant. Issues like maximum residue limit and acceptable daily intake limit are being discussed for CIPC. This article brings an update on practical aspects of potato storage, residue levels of CIPC, efficacy of CIPC as sprout suppressant and health and environmental safety issues linked with CIPC and its metabolites. The aim of this article is to find possible solutions, way outs and future plans that can make the sprout suppression of potatoes safer and more risk free.

Claim: Updated CDC guidance on monkeypox transmission still includes 'respiratory transmission'.
Abstract: Planning a response to an outbreak of a pandemic strain of influenza is a high public health priority. Three research groups using different individual-based, stochastic simulation models have examined the consequences of intervention strategies chosen in consultation with U.S. public health workers. The first goal is to simulate the effectiveness of a set of potentially feasible intervention strategies. Combinations called targeted layered containment (TLC) of influenza antiviral treatment and prophylaxis and nonpharmaceutical interventions of quarantine, isolation, school closure, community social distancing, and workplace social distancing are considered. The second goal is to examine the robustness of the results to model assumptions. The comparisons focus on a pandemic outbreak in a population similar to that of Chicago, with ?8.6 million people. The simulations suggest that at the expected transmissibility of a pandemic strain, timely implementation of a combination of targeted household antiviral prophylaxis, and social distancing measures could substantially lower the illness attack rate before a highly efficacious vaccine could become available. Timely initiation of measures and school closure play important roles. Because of the current lack of data on which to base such models, further field research is recommended to learn more about the sources of transmission and the effectiveness of social distancing measures in reducing influenza transmission.

Claim: Sun exposure, and diet, causes skin cancers.
Abstract: Melanoma and keratinocyte skin cancer (KSC) are the most common types of cancer in White-skinned populations. Both tumor entities showed increasing incidence rates worldwide but stable or decreasing mortality rates. Rising incidence rates of cutaneous melanoma (CM) and KSC are largely attributed to increasing exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, the main causal risk factor for skin cancer. Incidence rates of KSC, comprising of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), are much higher than that of melanoma. BCC development is mainly the cause of an intensive UV exposure in childhood and adolescence, while SCC development is related to chronic, cumulative UV exposure over decades. Although mortality is relatively low, KSC is an increasing problem for health care services causing significant morbidity. Cutaneous melanoma is rapidly increasing in White populations, with an estimated annual increase of around 3-7% over the past decades. In contrast to SCC, melanoma risk is associated with intermittent and chronic exposure to sunlight. The frequency of its occurrence is closely associated with the constitutive color of the skin and the geographical zone. Changes in outdoor activities and exposure to sunlight during the past 70 years are an important factor for the increasing incidence of melanoma. Mortality rates of melanoma show stabilization in the USA, Australia, and in European countries. In the USA even dropping numbers of death cases were recently reported, probably reflecting efficacy of the new systemic treatments. Among younger cohorts in some populations (e.g., Australia and New Zealand,), stabilizing or declining incidence rates of CM are observed, potentially caused by primary prevention campaigns aimed at reducing UV exposure. In contrast, incidence rates of CM are still rising in most European countries and in the USA. Ongoing trends towards thinner melanoma are largely ascribed to earlier detection.

The rationale in this sentence is: “Among younger cohorts in some populations (e.g., Australia and New Zealand), stabilizing or declining incidence rates of CM [cutaneous melanoma] are observed, potentially caused by primary prevention campaigns aimed at reducing UV exposure.""

Claim: Targeting cancer cells with resonant frequencies has been shown to 'cure' cancer.
Abstract: In the 1920s and 1930s, Royal Raymond Rife developed special microscopes. Using these he claimed he could visualize living microorganisms, including viruses too small to be seen with any other existing technology, via the color of auras emitted as they vibrated (Citation1). In a 1961 deposition he explained this as follows: A special risley prism which works on a counter rotation principle selects a portion of the light frequency which illuminates these viruses in their own characteristic chemical colors by emission of coordinative light frequency and the viruses become readily identifiable by the colors revealed on observation. (Citation2). Several of his microscopes still exist. Their principles and alleged function have never been validated, and they have never been adopted for use. Rife went on to postulate that the microorganisms he was seeing were involved in human diseases, including cancer (Citation3-6). He invented a machine that he claimed could transmit radio frequency energy into a person and vibrate these microorganisms at a mortal oscillatory rate, thereby killing them and improving the disease they were causing (Citation3-6). Rife's claims were based upon his microscopic evaluations, which again do not appear to be legitimate. The very concept that diseases can be cured by radio frequency energy, originally proposed by Albert Abrams and referred to as 'radionics' (Citation7), was later investigated and disproven by the Scientific American (Citation7,Citation8).

Claim: People with asymptomatic COVID-19 in acute phase will not develop long COVID symptoms.
Abstract: In this decision analytical model of multiple scenarios of proportions of asymptomatic individuals with COVID-19 and infectious periods, transmission from asymptomatic individuals was estimated to account for more than half of all transmissions. In addition to identification and isolation of persons with symptomatic COVID-19, effective control of spread will require reducing the risk of transmission from people with infection who do not have symptoms. These findings suggest that measures such as wearing masks, hand hygiene, social distancing, and strategic testing of people who are not ill will be foundational to slowing the spread of COVID-19 until safe and effective vaccines are available and widely used.

Claim: COVID-19 vaccines cause 93% of deaths that occur after inoculation
Abstract: The vaccines are bad news. Fifteen bodies were examined (all died from 7 days to 6 months after vaccination; ages 28 to 95). The coroner or the public prosecutor didn't associate the vaccine as the cause of death in any of the cases. However, further examination revealed that the vaccine was implicated in the deaths of 14 of the 15 cases. The most attacked organ was the heart (in all of the people who died), but other organs were attacked as well. The implications are potentially enormous resulting in millions of deaths. The vaccines should be immediately halted.

The abstract discusses the examination of fifteen bodies of individuals who died from 7 days to 6 months after vaccination. The coroner or public prosecutor did not associate the vaccine as the cause of death in any of the cases. However, further examination revealed that the vaccine was implicated in the deaths of 14 of the 15 cases. The heart was the most attacked organ, but other organs were also affected. The abstract suggests that the implications could be enormous, potentially resulting in millions of deaths, and recommends that the vaccines should be immediately halted.
Step 2: Identify the relevant statement: “However, further examination revealed that the vaccine was implicated in the deaths of 14 of the 15 cases.”
Step 3: Give reasoning to rationalize your decision: The abstract suggests that the vaccine was implicated in the deaths of 14 out of 15 cases examined, which is approximately 93% of the cases. However, it is important to note that this is a small sample size and may not be representative of the larger population.
Step 4: Conclusion: The abstract supports the claim in the scientific news. The rationale in this sentence is: “However, further examination revealed that the vaccine was implicated in the deaths of 14 of the 15 cases.”"

Claim: Updated CDC guidance on monkeypox transmission still includes 'respiratory transmission'.
Abstract: Planning a response to an outbreak of a pandemic strain of influenza is a high public health priority. Three research groups using different individual-based, stochastic simulation models have examined the consequences of intervention strategies chosen in consultation with U.S. public health workers. The first goal is to simulate the effectiveness of a set of potentially feasible intervention strategies. Combinations called targeted layered containment (TLC) of influenza antiviral treatment and prophylaxis and nonpharmaceutical interventions of quarantine, isolation, school closure, community social distancing, and workplace social distancing are considered. The second goal is to examine the robustness of the results to model assumptions. The comparisons focus on a pandemic outbreak in a population similar to that of Chicago, with ?8.6 million people. The simulations suggest that at the expected transmissibility of a pandemic strain, timely implementation of a combination of targeted household antiviral prophylaxis, and social distancing measures could substantially lower the illness attack rate before a highly efficacious vaccine could become available. Timely initiation of measures and school closure play important roles. Because of the current lack of data on which to base such models, further field research is recommended to learn more about the sources of transmission and the effectiveness of social distancing measures in reducing influenza transmission.

Claim: Sun exposure, and diet, causes skin cancers.
Abstract: Melanoma and keratinocyte skin cancer (KSC) are the most common types of cancer in White-skinned populations. Both tumor entities showed increasing incidence rates worldwide but stable or decreasing mortality rates. Rising incidence rates of cutaneous melanoma (CM) and KSC are largely attributed to increasing exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, the main causal risk factor for skin cancer. Incidence rates of KSC, comprising of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), are much higher than that of melanoma. BCC development is mainly the cause of an intensive UV exposure in childhood and adolescence, while SCC development is related to chronic, cumulative UV exposure over decades. Although mortality is relatively low, KSC is an increasing problem for health care services causing significant morbidity. Cutaneous melanoma is rapidly increasing in White populations, with an estimated annual increase of around 3-7% over the past decades. In contrast to SCC, melanoma risk is associated with intermittent and chronic exposure to sunlight. The frequency of its occurrence is closely associated with the constitutive color of the skin and the geographical zone. Changes in outdoor activities and exposure to sunlight during the past 70 years are an important factor for the increasing incidence of melanoma. Mortality rates of melanoma show stabilization in the USA, Australia, and in European countries. In the USA even dropping numbers of death cases were recently reported, probably reflecting efficacy of the new systemic treatments. Among younger cohorts in some populations (e.g., Australia and New Zealand,), stabilizing or declining incidence rates of CM are observed, potentially caused by primary prevention campaigns aimed at reducing UV exposure. In contrast, incidence rates of CM are still rising in most European countries and in the USA. Ongoing trends towards thinner melanoma are largely ascribed to earlier detection.

Answer: Step 1: Read the whole abstract and extract information relevant to the question. The abstract highlights that melanoma and keratinocyte skin cancer (KSC) are the most common types of cancer in White-skinned populations, with increasing incidence rates worldwide but stable or decreasing mortality rates. The rising incidence rates are largely attributed to increasing exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Incidence rates of KSC, comprising basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), are much higher than that of melanoma. Additionally, it discusses the factors contributing to the development of BCC and SCC, as well as the risk factors associated with melanoma. Furthermore, it mentions the trends in mortality rates of melanoma, primary prevention campaigns aimed at reducing UV exposure, and ongoing trends towards thinner melanoma largely ascribed to earlier detection.
Step 2: Identify the relevant statement: “Among younger cohorts in some populations (e.g., Australia and New Zealand), stabilizing or declining incidence rates of CM [cutaneous melanoma] are observed, potentially caused by primary prevention campaigns aimed at reducing UV exposure.""
Step 3: Give reasoning to rationalize your decision: The stabilization or decline in CM rates in younger cohorts is attributed to successful primary prevention campaigns that aim to reduce UV exposure, indicating that targeted public health measures can effectively mitigate the rising trend of melanoma in specific demographics. 
Step 4: Conclusion: The abstract refutes the claim in the scientific news. The rationale in this sentence is: “Among younger cohorts in some populations (e.g., Australia and New Zealand), stabilizing or declining incidence rates of CM [cutaneous melanoma] are observed, potentially caused by primary prevention campaigns aimed at reducing UV exposure.""

Claim: Targeting cancer cells with resonant frequencies has been shown to 'cure' cancer.
Abstract: In the 1920s and 1930s, Royal Raymond Rife developed special microscopes. Using these he claimed he could visualize living microorganisms, including viruses too small to be seen with any other existing technology, via the color of auras emitted as they vibrated (Citation1). In a 1961 deposition he explained this as follows: A special risley prism which works on a counter rotation principle selects a portion of the light frequency which illuminates these viruses in their own characteristic chemical colors by emission of coordinative light frequency and the viruses become readily identifiable by the colors revealed on observation. (Citation2). Several of his microscopes still exist. Their principles and alleged function have never been validated, and they have never been adopted for use. Rife went on to postulate that the microorganisms he was seeing were involved in human diseases, including cancer (Citation3-6). He invented a machine that he claimed could transmit radio frequency energy into a person and vibrate these microorganisms at a mortal oscillatory rate, thereby killing them and improving the disease they were causing (Citation3-6). Rife's claims were based upon his microscopic evaluations, which again do not appear to be legitimate. The very concept that diseases can be cured by radio frequency energy, originally proposed by Albert Abrams and referred to as 'radionics' (Citation7), was later investigated and disproven by the Scientific American (Citation7,Citation8). Nonetheless, there remain those who believe in Rife's work, claim it was suppressed as part of an elaborate conspiracy (Citation9) and continue to sell similar energy-transmitting devices (Citation10-12). Here, on behalf of PALS who asked about it, we review the potential use of the Rife Machine for ALS.

Claim: U.S. carrots are 'soaked' in bleach, chlorpropham is used.
Abstract: World over, potatoes are being stored at 8-12 ¬∞C (85-90 % RH). This is the most common way of long-term (up to 6 to 9 months) storage of potatoes. The benefit of storing the potatoes within the temperature range of 8-12 ¬∞C is minimum accumulation of sugars in stored potato tubers. In sub-temperate, sub-tropical and tropical countries of the world, short-term (3 to 4 months) storage of potatoes is being done by non-refrigerated traditional/on-farm methods. These short- and long-term storage methods keep the stored potatoes suitable not only for table purpose but also for processing. However, once the natural dormancy period of potato is over, the prevailing temperatures in these storage methods favour sprouting and sprout growth. Therefore, use of some sprout suppressant to check the sprout growth becomes essential under these methods of potato storage. CIPC [Isopropyl N-(3-chlorophenyl) carbamate] is the most wide spread and commonly used sprout suppressant on potatoes. CIPC has been in use for more than 50 years and research carried out over such a long period use of CIPC has not only enhanced our understanding of its properties and chemistry but also about the production and toxicological status of its metabolites/degradation products. Today, various safety issues and concerns have surfaced primarily due to continuous and long-term use of CIPC. This review presents an appraisal on CIPC and explains the reasons for the long-time dependence on this chemical as a potato sprout suppressant. Issues like maximum residue limit and acceptable daily intake limit are being discussed for CIPC. This article brings an update on practical aspects of potato storage, residue levels of CIPC, efficacy of CIPC as sprout suppressant and health and environmental safety issues linked with CIPC and its metabolites. The aim of this article is to find possible solutions, way outs and future plans that can make the sprout suppression of potatoes safer and more risk free.

Claim: COVID-19 can only be caught once
Abstract: Many individuals test positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA after recovering from the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), but the incidence of reactivation is unknown. We, therefore, estimated the incidence of reactivation among individuals who had recovered from COVID-19 and determined its predictors. In this retrospective cohort study, patients with COVID-19 were followed up for at least 14 days after two consecutive negative SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction test results obtained ?24?h apart, and the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 reactivation was assessed. Of the 109 patients, 29 (27%) experienced reactivation, and seven (24%) of these were symptomatic. The mean period for the real-time PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 from negative to positive results was 17 days. Compared with patients without reactivation, those with reactivation were significantly younger and more likely to have a lymphocyte count of <1500/?L (odds ratio [OR]: 0.34, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.12-0.94) and two or fewer symptoms (OR: 0.20, 95% CI: 0.07-0.55) during the initial episode. Risk-stratified surveillance should be conducted among patients who have recovered from COVID-19.

Claim: Evidence shows that COVID-19 vaccines affect male fertility.
Abstract: In this study of sperm parameters before and after 2 doses of a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine, there were no significant decreases in any sperm parameter among this small cohort of healthy men. Because the vaccines contain mRNA and not the live virus, it is unlikely that the vaccine would affect sperm parameters. While these results showed statistically significant increases in all sperm parameters, the magnitude of change is within normal individual variation and may be influenced by regression to the mean.5 Additionally, the increase may be due to the increased abstinence time before the second sample. Men with oligospermia did not experience further decline.The limitations of the study include the small number of men enrolled; limited generalizability beyond young, healthy men; short follow-up; and lack of a control group. In addition, while semen analysis is the foundation of male fertility evaluation, it is an imperfect predictor of fertility potential. Despite this, the study's time frame encompasses the full life cycle of sperm.

Incidence rates of KSC, comprising of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), are much higher than that of melanoma. BCC development is mainly the cause of an intensive UV exposure in childhood and adolescence, while SCC development is related to chronic, cumulative UV exposure over decades. Although mortality is relatively low, KSC is an increasing problem for health care services causing significant morbidity. Cutaneous melanoma is rapidly increasing in White populations, with an estimated annual increase of around 3-7% over the past decades. In contrast to SCC, melanoma risk is associated with intermittent and chronic exposure to sunlight. The frequency of its occurrence is closely associated with the constitutive color of the skin and the geographical zone. Changes in outdoor activities and exposure to sunlight during the past 70 years are an important factor for the increasing incidence of melanoma. Mortality rates of melanoma show stabilization in the USA, Australia, and in European countries. In the USA even dropping numbers of death cases were recently reported, probably reflecting efficacy of the new systemic treatments. Among younger cohorts in some populations (e.g., Australia and New Zealand,), stabilizing or declining incidence rates of CM are observed, potentially caused by primary prevention campaigns aimed at reducing UV exposure. In contrast, incidence rates of CM are still rising in most European countries and in the USA. Ongoing trends towards thinner melanoma are largely ascribed to earlier detection.
Question: Does the abstract of the scientific paper support the claim?

Answer: Step 1: Read the whole abstract and extract information relevant to the question. The abstract highlights that melanoma and keratinocyte skin cancer (KSC) are the most common types of cancer in White-skinned populations, with increasing incidence rates worldwide but stable or decreasing mortality rates. The rising incidence rates are largely attributed to increasing exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Incidence rates of KSC, comprising basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), are much higher than that of melanoma. Additionally, it discusses the factors contributing to the development of BCC and SCC, as well as the risk factors associated with melanoma. Furthermore, it mentions the trends in mortality rates of melanoma, primary prevention campaigns aimed at reducing UV exposure, and ongoing trends towards thinner melanoma largely ascribed to earlier detection.
Step 2: Identify the relevant statement: “Among younger cohorts in some populations (e.g., Australia and New Zealand), stabilizing or declining incidence rates of CM [cutaneous melanoma] are observed, potentially caused by primary prevention campaigns aimed at reducing UV exposure.""
Step 3: Give reasoning to rationalize your decision: The stabilization or decline in CM rates in younger cohorts is attributed to successful primary prevention campaigns that aim to reduce UV exposure, indicating that targeted public health measures can effectively mitigate the rising trend of melanoma in specific demographics. 
Step 4: Conclusion: The abstract refutes the claim in the scientific news. The rationale in this sentence is: “Among younger cohorts in some populations (e.g., Australia and New Zealand), stabilizing or declining incidence rates of CM [cutaneous melanoma] are observed, potentially caused by primary prevention campaigns aimed at reducing UV exposure.""

Claim: Targeting cancer cells with resonant frequencies has been shown to 'cure' cancer.
Abstract: In the 1920s and 1930s, Royal Raymond Rife developed special microscopes. Using these he claimed he could visualize living microorganisms, including viruses too small to be seen with any other existing technology, via the color of auras emitted as they vibrated (Citation1). In a 1961 deposition he explained this as follows: A special risley prism which works on a counter rotation principle selects a portion of the light frequency which illuminates these viruses in their own characteristic chemical colors by emission of coordinative light frequency and the viruses become readily identifiable by the colors revealed on observation. (Citation2). Several of his microscopes still exist. Their principles and alleged function have never been validated, and they have never been adopted for use. Rife went on to postulate that the microorganisms he was seeing were involved in human diseases, including cancer (Citation3-6). He invented a machine that he claimed could transmit radio frequency energy into a person and vibrate these microorganisms at a mortal oscillatory rate, thereby killing them and improving the disease they were causing (Citation3-6). Rife's claims were based upon his microscopic evaluations, which again do not appear to be legitimate. The very concept that diseases can be cured by radio frequency energy, originally proposed by Albert Abrams and referred to as 'radionics' (Citation7), was later investigated and disproven by the Scientific American (Citation7,Citation8). Nonetheless, there remain those who believe in Rife's work, claim it was suppressed as part of an elaborate conspiracy (Citation9) and continue to sell similar energy-transmitting devices (Citation10-12). Here, on behalf of PALS who asked about it, we review the potential use of the Rife Machine for ALS.

Claim: U.S. carrots are 'soaked' in bleach, chlorpropham is used.
Abstract: World over, potatoes are being stored at 8-12 ¬∞C (85-90 % RH). This is the most common way of long-term (up to 6 to 9 months) storage of potatoes. The benefit of storing the potatoes within the temperature range of 8-12 ¬∞C is minimum accumulation of sugars in stored potato tubers. In sub-temperate, sub-tropical and tropical countries of the world, short-term (3 to 4 months) storage of potatoes is being done by non-refrigerated traditional/on-farm methods. These short- and long-term storage methods keep the stored potatoes suitable not only for table purpose but also for processing. However, once the natural dormancy period of potato is over, the prevailing temperatures in these storage methods favour sprouting and sprout growth. Therefore, use of some sprout suppressant to check the sprout growth becomes essential under these methods of potato storage. CIPC [Isopropyl N-(3-chlorophenyl) carbamate] is the most wide spread and commonly used sprout suppressant on potatoes. CIPC has been in use for more than 50 years and research carried out over such a long period use of CIPC has not only enhanced our understanding of its properties and chemistry but also about the production and toxicological status of its metabolites/degradation products. Today, various safety issues and concerns have surfaced primarily due to continuous and long-term use of CIPC. This review presents an appraisal on CIPC and explains the reasons for the long-time dependence on this chemical as a potato sprout suppressant. Issues like maximum residue limit and acceptable daily intake limit are being discussed for CIPC. This article brings an update on practical aspects of potato storage, residue levels of CIPC, efficacy of CIPC as sprout suppressant and health and environmental safety issues linked with CIPC and its metabolites. The aim of this article is to find possible solutions, way outs and future plans that can make the sprout suppression of potatoes safer and more risk free.

Claim: Vaccines help reduce transmission by preventing infection in the first place, as well as reducing how infectious a person becomes once infected.
Abstract: The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine's efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 peaked at 96.2% at seven days to two months after the second dose and then declined to 83.7% at four months, a preprint from Pfizer has reported. The preprint, which contains the latest data from the original clinical trial, found an average decline in vaccine efficacy of 6% every two months. Researchers have said that trials to evaluate the efficacy of booster trials after a longer interval are under way. A booster vaccine in England is expected to be rolled out to the people most vulnerable to covid-19 from September. Around 44?000 people aged over 16 were recruited to the clinical trials from July to October 2020, including participants from the US, Argentina, Brazil, South Africa, Germany, and Turkey. Of these, half were given the Pfizer vaccine and half were given the placebo, a saline solution. The study also included around 2200 participants aged 12 to 15 at 29 US sites, recruited from October 2020 to January 2021, who were also randomly allocated 1:1 to receive the vaccine or placebo. The preprint said that from seven days after the second dose 86-100% efficacy was observed across diverse demographic profiles, including age, sex, race/ethnicity, and factors increasing the risk from covid-19, such as high body mass index and other comorbidities. The vaccine was reported as highly efficacious in various geographical regions including North America, Europe, South Africa, and Latin America.

Claim: Updated CDC guidance on monkeypox transmission still includes 'respiratory transmission'.
Abstract: Planning a response to an outbreak of a pandemic strain of influenza is a high public health priority. Three research groups using different individual-based, stochastic simulation models have examined the consequences of intervention strategies chosen in consultation with U.S. public health workers. The first goal is to simulate the effectiveness of a set of potentially feasible intervention strategies. Combinations called targeted layered containment (TLC) of influenza antiviral treatment and prophylaxis and nonpharmaceutical interventions of quarantine, isolation, school closure, community social distancing, and workplace social distancing are considered. The second goal is to examine the robustness of the results to model assumptions. The comparisons focus on a pandemic outbreak in a population similar to that of Chicago, with ?8.6 million people. The simulations suggest that at the expected transmissibility of a pandemic strain, timely implementation of a combination of targeted household antiviral prophylaxis, and social distancing measures could substantially lower the illness attack rate before a highly efficacious vaccine could become available. Timely initiation of measures and school closure play important roles. Because of the current lack of data on which to base such models, further field research is recommended to learn more about the sources of transmission and the effectiveness of social distancing measures in reducing influenza transmission.

Claim: Sun exposure, and diet, causes skin cancers.
Abstract: Melanoma and keratinocyte skin cancer (KSC) are the most common types of cancer in White-skinned populations.

Although mortality is relatively low, KSC is an increasing problem for health care services causing significant morbidity.

Here, on behalf of PALS who asked about it, we review the potential use of the Rife Machine for ALS.
Question: Does the abstract of the scientific paper support the claim?

Answer: Step 1: Read the whole abstract and extract information relevant to the question. The abstract describes the development of special microscopes by Royal Raymond Rife in the 1920s and 1930s. Rife claimed that these microscopes could visualize living microorganisms, including viruses, and that the colors emitted by these microorganisms allowed for their identification. Rife proposed that the microorganisms he observed were involved in human diseases, such as cancer, and invented a machine that he claimed could transmit radio frequency energy to kill these microorganisms and improve the associated diseases. However, Rife's claims and the concept of curing diseases with radio frequency energy have not been validated and were later disproven. Despite this, there are still people who believe in Rife's work and sell similar energy-transmitting devices.
Step 2: Identify the relevant statement: “The very concept that diseases can be cured by radio frequency energy, originally proposed by Albert Abrams and referred to as 'radionics' (Citation7), was later investigated and disproven by the Scientific American (Citation7,Citation8).”
Step 3: Give reasoning to rationalize your decision: Radionics has previously been investigated and disproved in research conducted by Scientific American and thereby cannot cure cancer. 
Step 4: Conclusion: The abstract refutes the claim in the news. The rationale is this sentence: “The very concept that diseases… disproven by the Scientific American (Citation7,Citation8).”

Claim: U.S. carrots are 'soaked' in bleach, chlorpropham is used.
Abstract: World over, potatoes are being stored at 8-12 ¬∞C (85-90 % RH). This is the most common way of long-term (up to 6 to 9 months) storage of potatoes. The benefit of storing the potatoes within the temperature range of 8-12 ¬∞C is minimum accumulation of sugars in stored potato tubers. In sub-temperate, sub-tropical and tropical countries of the world, short-term (3 to 4 months) storage of potatoes is being done by non-refrigerated traditional/on-farm methods. These short- and long-term storage methods keep the stored potatoes suitable not only for table purpose but also for processing. However, once the natural dormancy period of potato is over, the prevailing temperatures in these storage methods favour sprouting and sprout growth. Therefore, use of some sprout suppressant to check the sprout growth becomes essential under these methods of potato storage. CIPC [Isopropyl N-(3-chlorophenyl) carbamate] is the most wide spread and commonly used sprout suppressant on potatoes. CIPC has been in use for more than 50 years and research carried out over such a long period use of CIPC has not only enhanced our understanding of its properties and chemistry but also about the production and toxicological status of its metabolites/degradation products. Today, various safety issues and concerns have surfaced primarily due to continuous and long-term use of CIPC. This review presents an appraisal on CIPC and explains the reasons for the long-time dependence on this chemical as a potato sprout suppressant. Issues like maximum residue limit and acceptable daily intake limit are being discussed for CIPC. This article brings an update on practical aspects of potato storage, residue levels of CIPC, efficacy of CIPC as sprout suppressant and health and environmental safety issues linked with CIPC and its metabolites. The aim of this article is to find possible solutions, way outs and future plans that can make the sprout suppression of potatoes safer and more risk free.

Claim: Long COVID' is fake.
Abstract: The results of this cross-sectional analysis of a large, population-based French cohort suggest that physical symptoms persisting 10 to 12 months after the COVID-19 pandemic first wave may be associated more with the belief in having experienced COVID-19 infection than with actually being infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Although our study cannot determine the direction of the association between belief and symptoms, our results suggest that further research regarding persistent physical symptoms after COVID-19 infection should also consider mechanisms that may not be specific to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. From a clinical perspective, patients in this situation should be offered a medical evaluation to prevent their symptoms being erroneously attributed to COVID-19 infection and to identify cognitive and behavioral mechanisms that may be targeted to relieve the symptoms.

Claim: Updated CDC guidance on monkeypox transmission still includes 'respiratory transmission'.
Abstract: Planning a response to an outbreak of a pandemic strain of influenza is a high public health priority. Three research groups using different individual-based, stochastic simulation models have examined the consequences of intervention strategies chosen in consultation with U.S. public health workers. The first goal is to simulate the effectiveness of a set of potentially feasible intervention strategies. Combinations called targeted layered containment (TLC) of influenza antiviral treatment and prophylaxis and nonpharmaceutical interventions of quarantine, isolation, school closure, community social distancing, and workplace social distancing are considered. The second goal is to examine the robustness of the results to model assumptions. The comparisons focus on a pandemic outbreak in a population similar to that of Chicago, with ?8.6 million people. The simulations suggest that at the expected transmissibility of a pandemic strain, timely implementation of a combination of targeted household antiviral prophylaxis, and social distancing measures could substantially lower the illness attack rate before a highly efficacious vaccine could become available. Timely initiation of measures and school closure play important roles. Because of the current lack of data on which to base such models, further field research is recommended to learn more about the sources of transmission and the effectiveness of social distancing measures in reducing influenza transmission.

Claim: Sun exposure, and diet, causes skin cancers.
Abstract: Melanoma and keratinocyte skin cancer (KSC) are the most common types of cancer in White-skinned populations. Both tumor entities showed increasing incidence rates worldwide but stable or decreasing mortality rates. Rising incidence rates of cutaneous melanoma (CM) and KSC are largely attributed to increasing exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, the main causal risk factor for skin cancer. Incidence rates of KSC, comprising of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), are much higher than that of melanoma. BCC development is mainly the cause of an intensive UV exposure in childhood and adolescence, while SCC development is related to chronic, cumulative UV exposure over decades. Although mortality is relatively low, KSC is an increasing problem for health care services causing significant morbidity. Cutaneous melanoma is rapidly increasing in White populations, with an estimated annual increase of around 3-7% over the past decades. In contrast to SCC, melanoma risk is associated with intermittent and chronic exposure to sunlight. The frequency of its occurrence is closely associated with the constitutive color of the skin and the geographical zone. Changes in outdoor activities and exposure to sunlight during the past 70 years are an important factor for the increasing incidence of melanoma. Mortality rates of melanoma show stabilization in the USA, Australia, and in European countries. In the USA even dropping numbers of death cases were recently reported, probably reflecting efficacy of the new systemic treatments. Among younger cohorts in some populations (e.g., Australia and New Zealand,), stabilizing or declining incidence rates of CM are observed, potentially caused by primary prevention campaigns aimed at reducing UV exposure. In contrast, incidence rates of CM are still rising in most European countries and in the USA. Ongoing trends towards thinner melanoma are largely ascribed to earlier detection.

Claim: Targeting cancer cells with resonant frequencies has been shown to 'cure' cancer.
Abstract: In the 1920s and 1930s, Royal Raymond Rife developed special microscopes. Using these he claimed he could visualize living microorganisms, including viruses too small to be seen with any other existing technology, via the color of auras emitted as they vibrated (Citation1). In a 1961 deposition he explained this as follows: A special risley prism which works on a counter rotation principle selects a portion of the light frequency which illuminates these viruses in their own characteristic chemical colors by emission of coordinative light frequency and the viruses become readily identifiable by the colors revealed on observation. (Citation2). Several of his microscopes still exist. Their principles and alleged function have never been validated, and they have never been adopted for use. Rife went on to postulate that the microorganisms he was seeing were involved in human diseases, including cancer (Citation3-6). He invented a machine that he claimed could transmit radio frequency energy into a person and vibrate these microorganisms at a mortal oscillatory rate, thereby killing them and improving the disease they were causing (Citation3-6). Rife's claims were based upon his microscopic evaluations, which again do not appear to be legitimate. The very concept that diseases can be cured by radio frequency energy, originally proposed by Albert Abrams and referred to as 'radionics' (Citation7), was later investigated and disproven by the Scientific American (Citation7,Citation8).

Claim: No evidence aspirin is 'being attacked' because 'it's proven' to treat COVID-19
Abstract: Acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) is commonly used for primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases. Aspirin use is associated with better outcomes among COVID-19 positive patients. We hypothesized that the aspirin use for primary cardiovascular disease prevention might have a protective effect on COVID-19 susceptibility and disease duration. We conducted a retrospective population-based cross-sectional study, utilizing data from the Leumit Health Services database. The proportion of patients treated with aspirin was significantly lower among the COVID-19-positive group, as compared to the COVID-19-negative group [73 (11.03%) vs. 1548 (15.77%); P = 0.001]. Aspirin use was associated with lower likelihood of COVID-19 infection, as compared to nonusers (adjusted OR 0.71 (95% CI, 0.52 to 0.99; P = 0.041). Aspirin users were older (68.06 ¬± 12.79 vs. 56.63 ¬± 12.28 years of age; P < 0.001), presented a lower BMI (28.77 ¬± 5.4 vs. 30.37 ¬± 4.55; P < 0.0189), and showed higher prevalence of hypertension (56, 76.71%), diabetes (47, 64.38%), and COPD (11, 15.07%) than the aspirin nonusers (151, 25.64%, P < 0.001; 130, 22.07%, P < 0.001; and 43, 7.3%, P = 0.023, respectively). Moreover, COVID-19 disease duration (considered as the time between the first positive and second negative COVID-19 RT-PCR test results) among aspirin users was significantly shorter, as compared to aspirin nonusers (19.8 ¬± 7.8 vs. 21.9 ¬± 7.9 P = 0.045). Among hospitalized COVID-positive patients, a higher proportion of surviving subjects were treated with aspirin (20, 19.05%), as opposed to 1 dead subject (14.29%), although this difference was not significant (P = 0.449). In conclusion, we observed an inverse association between the likelihood of COVID-19 infection, disease duration and mortality, and aspirin use for primary prevention.
Question: Does the abstract of the scientific paper support the claim?

","Answer: Step 1: Read the whole abstract and extract information relevant to the question. The abstract discusses the use of aspirin for primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases and its association with better outcomes among COVID-19 positive patients. It presents the results of a retrospective population-based cross-sectional study, which found that the proportion of patients treated with aspirin was significantly lower among the COVID-19-positive group compared to the COVID-19-negative group.

Claim: Updated CDC guidance on monkeypox transmission still includes 'respiratory transmission'.
Abstract: Planning a response to an outbreak of a pandemic strain of influenza is a high public health priority. Three research groups using different individual-based, stochastic simulation models have examined the consequences of intervention strategies chosen in consultation with U.S. public health workers. The first goal is to simulate the effectiveness of a set of potentially feasible intervention strategies. Combinations called targeted layered containment (TLC) of influenza antiviral treatment and prophylaxis and nonpharmaceutical interventions of quarantine, isolation, school closure, community social distancing, and workplace social distancing are considered. The second goal is to examine the robustness of the results to model assumptions. The comparisons focus on a pandemic outbreak in a population similar to that of Chicago, with ?8.6 million people. The simulations suggest that at the expected transmissibility of a pandemic strain, timely implementation of a combination of targeted household antiviral prophylaxis, and social distancing measures could substantially lower the illness attack rate before a highly efficacious vaccine could become available. Timely initiation of measures and school closure play important roles. Because of the current lack of data on which to base such models, further field research is recommended to learn more about the sources of transmission and the effectiveness of social distancing measures in reducing influenza transmission.

Claim: Sun exposure, and diet, causes skin cancers.
Abstract: Melanoma and keratinocyte skin cancer (KSC) are the most common types of cancer in White-skinned populations. Both tumor entities showed increasing incidence rates worldwide but stable or decreasing mortality rates. Rising incidence rates of cutaneous melanoma (CM) and KSC are largely attributed to increasing exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, the main causal risk factor for skin cancer. Incidence rates of KSC, comprising of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), are much higher than that of melanoma. BCC development is mainly the cause of an intensive UV exposure in childhood and adolescence, while SCC development is related to chronic, cumulative UV exposure over decades. Although mortality is relatively low, KSC is an increasing problem for health care services causing significant morbidity. Cutaneous melanoma is rapidly increasing in White populations, with an estimated annual increase of around 3-7% over the past decades. In contrast to SCC, melanoma risk is associated with intermittent and chronic exposure to sunlight. The frequency of its occurrence is closely associated with the constitutive color of the skin and the geographical zone. Changes in outdoor activities and exposure to sunlight during the past 70 years are an important factor for the increasing incidence of melanoma. Mortality rates of melanoma show stabilization in the USA, Australia, and in European countries. In the USA even dropping numbers of death cases were recently reported, probably reflecting efficacy of the new systemic treatments. Among younger cohorts in some populations (e.g., Australia and New Zealand,), stabilizing or declining incidence rates of CM are observed, potentially caused by primary prevention campaigns aimed at reducing UV exposure. In contrast, incidence rates of CM are still rising in most European countries and in the USA. Ongoing trends towards thinner melanoma are largely ascribed to earlier detection.

The rationale in this sentence is: “Among younger cohorts in some populations (e.g., Australia and New Zealand), stabilizing or declining incidence rates of CM [cutaneous melanoma] are observed, potentially caused by primary prevention campaigns aimed at reducing UV exposure.""

Claim: Targeting cancer cells with resonant frequencies has been shown to 'cure' cancer.
Abstract: In the 1920s and 1930s, Royal Raymond Rife developed special microscopes. Using these he claimed he could visualize living microorganisms, including viruses too small to be seen with any other existing technology, via the color of auras emitted as they vibrated (Citation1). In a 1961 deposition he explained this as follows: A special risley prism which works on a counter rotation principle selects a portion of the light frequency which illuminates these viruses in their own characteristic chemical colors by emission of coordinative light frequency and the viruses become readily identifiable by the colors revealed on observation. (Citation2). Several of his microscopes still exist. Their principles and alleged function have never been validated, and they have never been adopted for use. Rife went on to postulate that the microorganisms he was seeing were involved in human diseases, including cancer (Citation3-6). He invented a machine that he claimed could transmit radio frequency energy into a person and vibrate these microorganisms at a mortal oscillatory rate, thereby killing them and improving the disease they were causing (Citation3-6). Rife's claims were based upon his microscopic evaluations, which again do not appear to be legitimate. The very concept that diseases can be cured by radio frequency energy, originally proposed by Albert Abrams and referred to as 'radionics' (Citation7), was later investigated and disproven by the Scientific American (Citation7,Citation8). Nonetheless, there remain those who believe in Rife's work, claim it was suppressed as part of an elaborate conspiracy (Citation9) and continue to sell similar energy-transmitting devices (Citation10-12). Here, on behalf of PALS who asked about it, we review the potential use of the Rife Machine for ALS.

Claim: U.S. carrots are 'soaked' in bleach, chlorpropham is used.
Abstract: World over, potatoes are being stored at 8-12 ¬∞C (85-90 % RH). This is the most common way of long-term (up to 6 to 9 months) storage of potatoes. The benefit of storing the potatoes within the temperature range of 8-12 ¬∞C is minimum accumulation of sugars in stored potato tubers. In sub-temperate, sub-tropical and tropical countries of the world, short-term (3 to 4 months) storage of potatoes is being done by non-refrigerated traditional/on-farm methods. These short- and long-term storage methods keep the stored potatoes suitable not only for table purpose but also for processing. However, once the natural dormancy period of potato is over, the prevailing temperatures in these storage methods favour sprouting and sprout growth. Therefore, use of some sprout suppressant to check the sprout growth becomes essential under these methods of potato storage. CIPC [Isopropyl N-(3-chlorophenyl) carbamate] is the most wide spread and commonly used sprout suppressant on potatoes. CIPC has been in use for more than 50 years and research carried out over such a long period use of CIPC has not only enhanced our understanding of its properties and chemistry but also about the production and toxicological status of its metabolites/degradation products. Today, various safety issues and concerns have surfaced primarily due to continuous and long-term use of CIPC. This review presents an appraisal on CIPC and explains the reasons for the long-time dependence on this chemical as a potato sprout suppressant. Issues like maximum residue limit and acceptable daily intake limit are being discussed for CIPC. This article brings an update on practical aspects of potato storage, residue levels of CIPC, efficacy of CIPC as sprout suppressant and health and environmental safety issues linked with CIPC and its metabolites. The aim of this article is to find possible solutions, way outs and future plans that can make the sprout suppression of potatoes safer and more risk free.

Claim: mRNA vaccines alter DNA
Abstract: Prolonged detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA and recurrence of PCR-positive tests have been widely reported in patients after recovery from COVID-19, but some of these patients do not appear to shed infectious virus. We investigated the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 RNAs can be reverse-transcribed and integrated into the DNA of human cells in culture and that transcription of the integrated sequences might account for some of the positive PCR tests seen in patients. In support of this hypothesis, we found that DNA copies of SARS-CoV-2 sequences can be integrated into the genome of infected human cells. We found target site duplications flanking the viral sequences and consensus LINE1 endonuclease recognition sequences at the integration sites, consistent with a LINE1 retrotransposon-mediated, target-primed reverse transcription and retroposition mechanism. We also found, in some patient-derived tissues, evidence suggesting that a large fraction of the viral sequences is transcribed from integrated DNA copies of viral sequences, generating viral-host chimeric transcripts. The integration and transcription of viral sequences may thus contribute to the detection of viral RNA by PCR in patients after infection and clinical recovery. Because we have detected only subgenomic sequences derived mainly from the 3? end of the viral genome integrated into the DNA of the host cell, infectious virus cannot be produced from the integrated subgenomic SARS-CoV-2 sequences.
Question: Does the abstract of the scientific paper support the claim?

","Answer: Step 1: Read the whole abstract and extract information relevant to the question. The abstract discusses the prolonged detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and recurrence of PCR-positive tests in patients after recovery from COVID-19. It investigates the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 RNAs can be reverse-transcribed and integrated into the DNA of human cells in culture. The study found that DNA copies of SARS-CoV-2 sequences can be integrated into the genome of infected human cells. However, it also states that only subgenomic sequences derived mainly from the 3? end of the viral genome are integrated into the DNA of the host cell, and infectious virus cannot be produced from the integrated subgenomic SARS-CoV-2 sequences.
Step 2: Identify the relevant statement: “We investigated the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 RNAs can be reverse-transcribed and integrated into the DNA of human cells in culture and that transcription of the integrated sequences might account for some of the positive PCR tests seen in patients.”
Step 3: Give reasoning to rationalize your decision: The abstract discusses the integration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA into the DNA of human cells, which is a different process from the mechanism of mRNA vaccines. mRNA vaccines work by introducing a small piece of mRNA from the virus into the body, which cells then use as a blueprint to build a protein that triggers an immune response. This process does not involve integrating the mRNA into the host's DNA.
Step 4: Conclusion: The abstract does not support the claim in the scientific news. The rationale in this sentence is: “We investigated the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 RNAs can be reverse-transcribed and integrated into the DNA of human cells in culture and that transcription of the integrated sequences might account for some of the positive PCR tests seen in patients.”"

Claim: No evidence graphene oxide is present in available COVID-19 vaccines via lipid nanoparticles
Abstract: Polydispersed graphene was synthesized by grafting a thin layer of water-soluble amine functionalized polyethylene glycol monomethyl ether (PEG-NH2). PEG-NH2 functionalized graphene (PEG@rGO) was then introduced into epoxy resin via a facile solution mixing method. Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) verified that PEG was successfully grafted to the surface of graphene. The obtained PEG@rGO showed excellent dispersibility in solvents when compared to pristine graphene. As a core-shell filler, PEG@rGO filled epoxy nanocomposites displayed improved dielectric constant and reduced dielectric loss, exhibiting potential applications in energy storage capacitors. The mechanical strength and final decomposition temperature were also simultaneously increased.

Claim: Updated CDC guidance on monkeypox transmission still includes 'respiratory transmission'.
Abstract: Planning a response to an outbreak of a pandemic strain of influenza is a high public health priority. Three research groups using different individual-based, stochastic simulation models have examined the consequences of intervention strategies chosen in consultation with U.S. public health workers. The first goal is to simulate the effectiveness of a set of potentially feasible intervention strategies. Combinations called targeted layered containment (TLC) of influenza antiviral treatment and prophylaxis and nonpharmaceutical interventions of quarantine, isolation, school closure, community social distancing, and workplace social distancing are considered. The second goal is to examine the robustness of the results to model assumptions. The comparisons focus on a pandemic outbreak in a population similar to that of Chicago, with ?8.6 million people. The simulations suggest that at the expected transmissibility of a pandemic strain, timely implementation of a combination of targeted household antiviral prophylaxis, and social distancing measures could substantially lower the illness attack rate before a highly efficacious vaccine could become available. Timely initiation of measures and school closure play important roles. Because of the current lack of data on which to base such models, further field research is recommended to learn more about the sources of transmission and the effectiveness of social distancing measures in reducing influenza transmission.

Claim: Sun exposure, and diet, causes skin cancers.
Abstract: Melanoma and keratinocyte skin cancer (KSC) are the most common types of cancer in White-skinned populations. Both tumor entities showed increasing incidence rates worldwide but stable or decreasing mortality rates. Rising incidence rates of cutaneous melanoma (CM) and KSC are largely attributed to increasing exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, the main causal risk factor for skin cancer. Incidence rates of KSC, comprising of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), are much higher than that of melanoma. BCC development is mainly the cause of an intensive UV exposure in childhood and adolescence, while SCC development is related to chronic, cumulative UV exposure over decades. Although mortality is relatively low, KSC is an increasing problem for health care services causing significant morbidity. Cutaneous melanoma is rapidly increasing in White populations, with an estimated annual increase of around 3-7% over the past decades. In contrast to SCC, melanoma risk is associated with intermittent and chronic exposure to sunlight. The frequency of its occurrence is closely associated with the constitutive color of the skin and the geographical zone. Changes in outdoor activities and exposure to sunlight during the past 70 years are an important factor for the increasing incidence of melanoma. Mortality rates of melanoma show stabilization in the USA, Australia, and in European countries. In the USA even dropping numbers of death cases were recently reported, probably reflecting efficacy of the new systemic treatments. Among younger cohorts in some populations (e.g., Australia and New Zealand,), stabilizing or declining incidence rates of CM are observed, potentially caused by primary prevention campaigns aimed at reducing UV exposure. In contrast, incidence rates of CM are still rising in most European countries and in the USA. Ongoing trends towards thinner melanoma are largely ascribed to earlier detection.

Claim: Targeting cancer cells with resonant frequencies has been shown to 'cure' cancer.
Abstract: In the 1920s and 1930s, Royal Raymond Rife developed special microscopes. Using these he claimed he could visualize living microorganisms, including viruses too small to be seen with any other existing technology, via the color of auras emitted as they vibrated (Citation1). In a 1961 deposition he explained this as follows: A special risley prism which works on a counter rotation principle selects a portion of the light frequency which illuminates these viruses in their own characteristic chemical colors by emission of coordinative light frequency and the viruses become readily identifiable by the colors revealed on observation. (Citation2). Several of his microscopes still exist. Their principles and alleged function have never been validated, and they have never been adopted for use. Rife went on to postulate that the microorganisms he was seeing were involved in human diseases, including cancer (Citation3-6). He invented a machine that he claimed could transmit radio frequency energy into a person and vibrate these microorganisms at a mortal oscillatory rate, thereby killing them and improving the disease they were causing (Citation3-6). Rife's claims were based upon his microscopic evaluations, which again do not appear to be legitimate. The very concept that diseases can be cured by radio frequency energy, originally proposed by Albert Abrams and referred to as 'radionics' (Citation7), was later investigated and disproven by the Scientific American (Citation7,Citation8). Nonetheless, there remain those who believe in Rife's work, claim it was suppressed as part of an elaborate conspiracy (Citation9) and continue to sell similar energy-transmitting devices (Citation10-12). Here, on behalf of PALS who asked about it, we review the potential use of the Rife Machine for ALS.

Claim: U.S. carrots are 'soaked' in bleach, chlorpropham is used.
Abstract: World over, potatoes are being stored at 8-12 ¬∞C (85-90 % RH). This is the most common way of long-term (up to 6 to 9 months) storage of potatoes. The benefit of storing the potatoes within the temperature range of 8-12 ¬∞C is minimum accumulation of sugars in stored potato tubers. In sub-temperate, sub-tropical and tropical countries of the world, short-term (3 to 4 months) storage of potatoes is being done by non-refrigerated traditional/on-farm methods. These short- and long-term storage methods keep the stored potatoes suitable not only for table purpose but also for processing. However, once the natural dormancy period of potato is over, the prevailing temperatures in these storage methods favour sprouting and sprout growth. Therefore, use of some sprout suppressant to check the sprout growth becomes essential under these methods of potato storage. CIPC [Isopropyl N-(3-chlorophenyl) carbamate] is the most wide spread and commonly used sprout suppressant on potatoes. CIPC has been in use for more than 50 years and research carried out over such a long period use of CIPC has not only enhanced our understanding of its properties and chemistry but also about the production and toxicological status of its metabolites/degradation products. Today, various safety issues and concerns have surfaced primarily due to continuous and long-term use of CIPC. This review presents an appraisal on CIPC and explains the reasons for the long-time dependence on this chemical as a potato sprout suppressant. Issues like maximum residue limit and acceptable daily intake limit are being discussed for CIPC. This article brings an update on practical aspects of potato storage, residue levels of CIPC, efficacy of CIPC as sprout suppressant and health and environmental safety issues linked with CIPC and its metabolites. The aim of this article is to find possible solutions, way outs and future plans that can make the sprout suppression of potatoes safer and more risk free.

Claim: Overdose of fentanyl just by being in its presence is possible.
Abstract: Although toxicologists, medical professionals, and service providers have determined that the risk of overdose from fentanyl exposure is extremely low for law enforcement and other first responders, hundreds of media and social media accounts contradict these facts, making these civil servants unnecessarily concerned about such occupational hazards. We conducted a qualitative study to explore knowledge and fear of fentanyl exposure by interviewing 23 law enforcement leaders and officers in five diverse law enforcement agencies in the United States. Nearly all leaders and officers interviewed wrongly believed that dermal exposure to fentanyl was deadly and expressed fear about such exposure on scene. Officers had a lack of education about fentanyl exposure and faulty or dubious sources of information about it. There is a substantial, pressing need for dissemination of research about the lack of overdose risk associated with dermal fentanyl exposure through channels that law enforcement trust, including through basic academy, in-service training, and law enforcement bulletins and newsletters.

Abstract: In December 2019, the novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in the city of Wuhan in Hubei province, People's Republic of China, as the etiologic agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has hence spread worldwide causing a global pandemic (1-3). The epidemic has been growing exponentially in Italy for the last month, affecting over 60,000 individuals so far and with a heavy mortality burden. Italy is only anticipating what will be the trend in the whole of Europe and elsewhere. At the beginning of March 2020, the first nasopharyngeal swabs positive for SARS-CoV-2 started to be detected in the Northern Eastern Region of Friuli-Venezia Giulia. These identifications followed the expansion of the two clusters in Lombardy and Veneto that emerged in the previous weeks in northern Italy (4). Swab contents were seeded on Vero E6 cells and monitored for cytopathic effect and by an RT-PCR protocol using primers for the N region (5). Cell culture supernatants from passage 1 (P1) of four isolates were collected, and RNA was extracted with QIAamp viral RNA minikit (Qiagen) and quantified with an in vitro-transcribed RNA standard (S. Rajasekharan and A. Marcello, unpublished data). The quantity and quality of the RNA were assessed using Qubit 2.0 fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies).

Claim: Sun exposure, and diet, causes skin cancers.
Abstract: Melanoma and keratinocyte skin cancer (KSC) are the most common types of cancer in White-skinned populations. Both tumor entities showed increasing incidence rates worldwide but stable or decreasing mortality rates. Rising incidence rates of cutaneous melanoma (CM) and KSC are largely attributed to increasing exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, the main causal risk factor for skin cancer. Incidence rates of KSC, comprising of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), are much higher than that of melanoma. BCC development is mainly the cause of an intensive UV exposure in childhood and adolescence, while SCC development is related to chronic, cumulative UV exposure over decades. Although mortality is relatively low, KSC is an increasing problem for health care services causing significant morbidity. Cutaneous melanoma is rapidly increasing in White populations, with an estimated annual increase of around 3-7% over the past decades. In contrast to SCC, melanoma risk is associated with intermittent and chronic exposure to sunlight. The frequency of its occurrence is closely associated with the constitutive color of the skin and the geographical zone. Changes in outdoor activities and exposure to sunlight during the past 70 years are an important factor for the increasing incidence of melanoma. Mortality rates of melanoma show stabilization in the USA, Australia, and in European countries. In the USA even dropping numbers of death cases were recently reported, probably reflecting efficacy of the new systemic treatments. Among younger cohorts in some populations (e.g., Australia and New Zealand,), stabilizing or declining incidence rates of CM are observed, potentially caused by primary prevention campaigns aimed at reducing UV exposure. In contrast, incidence rates of CM are still rising in most European countries and in the USA. Ongoing trends towards thinner melanoma are largely ascribed to earlier detection.
Question: Does the abstract of the scientific paper support the claim?

Answer: Step 1: Read the whole abstract and extract information relevant to the question. The abstract highlights that melanoma and keratinocyte skin cancer (KSC) are the most common types of cancer in White-skinned populations, with increasing incidence rates worldwide but stable or decreasing mortality rates. The rising incidence rates are largely attributed to increasing exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation.

Claim: Targeting cancer cells with resonant frequencies has been shown to 'cure' cancer.
Abstract: In the 1920s and 1930s, Royal Raymond Rife developed special microscopes. Using these he claimed he could visualize living microorganisms, including viruses too small to be seen with any other existing technology, via the color of auras emitted as they vibrated (Citation1). In a 1961 deposition he explained this as follows: A special risley prism which works on a counter rotation principle selects a portion of the light frequency which illuminates these viruses in their own characteristic chemical colors by emission of coordinative light frequency and the viruses become readily identifiable by the colors revealed on observation. (Citation2). Several of his microscopes still exist. Their principles and alleged function have never been validated, and they have never been adopted for use. Rife went on to postulate that the microorganisms he was seeing were involved in human diseases, including cancer (Citation3-6). He invented a machine that he claimed could transmit radio frequency energy into a person and vibrate these microorganisms at a mortal oscillatory rate, thereby killing them and improving the disease they were causing (Citation3-6). Rife's claims were based upon his microscopic evaluations, which again do not appear to be legitimate. The very concept that diseases can be cured by radio frequency energy, originally proposed by Albert Abrams and referred to as 'radionics' (Citation7), was later investigated and disproven by the Scientific American (Citation7,Citation8). Nonetheless, there remain those who believe in Rife's work, claim it was suppressed as part of an elaborate conspiracy (Citation9) and continue to sell similar energy-transmitting devices (Citation10-12). Here, on behalf of PALS who asked about it, we review the potential use of the Rife Machine for ALS.

Claim: U.S. carrots are 'soaked' in bleach, chlorpropham is used.
Abstract: World over, potatoes are being stored at 8-12 ¬∞C (85-90 % RH). This is the most common way of long-term (up to 6 to 9 months) storage of potatoes. The benefit of storing the potatoes within the temperature range of 8-12 ¬∞C is minimum accumulation of sugars in stored potato tubers. In sub-temperate, sub-tropical and tropical countries of the world, short-term (3 to 4 months) storage of potatoes is being done by non-refrigerated traditional/on-farm methods. These short- and long-term storage methods keep the stored potatoes suitable not only for table purpose but also for processing. However, once the natural dormancy period of potato is over, the prevailing temperatures in these storage methods favour sprouting and sprout growth. Therefore, use of some sprout suppressant to check the sprout growth becomes essential under these methods of potato storage. CIPC [Isopropyl N-(3-chlorophenyl) carbamate] is the most wide spread and commonly used sprout suppressant on potatoes. CIPC has been in use for more than 50 years and research carried out over such a long period use of CIPC has not only enhanced our understanding of its properties and chemistry but also about the production and toxicological status of its metabolites/degradation products. Today, various safety issues and concerns have surfaced primarily due to continuous and long-term use of CIPC. This review presents an appraisal on CIPC and explains the reasons for the long-time dependence on this chemical as a potato sprout suppressant. Issues like maximum residue limit and acceptable daily intake limit are being discussed for CIPC. This article brings an update on practical aspects of potato storage, residue levels of CIPC, efficacy of CIPC as sprout suppressant and health and environmental safety issues linked with CIPC and its metabolites. The aim of this article is to find possible solutions, way outs and future plans that can make the sprout suppression of potatoes safer and more risk free.

Claim: Updated CDC guidance on monkeypox transmission still includes 'respiratory transmission'.
Abstract: Planning a response to an outbreak of a pandemic strain of influenza is a high public health priority. Three research groups using different individual-based, stochastic simulation models have examined the consequences of intervention strategies chosen in consultation with U.S. public health workers. The first goal is to simulate the effectiveness of a set of potentially feasible intervention strategies. Combinations called targeted layered containment (TLC) of influenza antiviral treatment and prophylaxis and nonpharmaceutical interventions of quarantine, isolation, school closure, community social distancing, and workplace social distancing are considered. The second goal is to examine the robustness of the results to model assumptions. The comparisons focus on a pandemic outbreak in a population similar to that of Chicago, with ?8.6 million people. The simulations suggest that at the expected transmissibility of a pandemic strain, timely implementation of a combination of targeted household antiviral prophylaxis, and social distancing measures could substantially lower the illness attack rate before a highly efficacious vaccine could become available. Timely initiation of measures and school closure play important roles. Because of the current lack of data on which to base such models, further field research is recommended to learn more about the sources of transmission and the effectiveness of social distancing measures in reducing influenza transmission.

Rife claimed that these microscopes could visualize living microorganisms, including viruses, and that the colors emitted by these microorganisms allowed for their identification. Rife proposed that the microorganisms he observed were involved in human diseases, such as cancer, and invented a machine that he claimed could transmit radio frequency energy to kill these microorganisms and improve the associated diseases. However, Rife's claims and the concept of curing diseases with radio frequency energy have not been validated and were later disproven. Despite this, there are still people who believe in Rife's work and sell similar energy-transmitting devices.
Step 2: Identify the relevant statement: “The very concept that diseases can be cured by radio frequency energy, originally proposed by Albert Abrams and referred to as 'radionics' (Citation7), was later investigated and disproven by the Scientific American (Citation7,Citation8).”
Step 3: Give reasoning to rationalize your decision: Radionics has previously been investigated and disproved in research conducted by Scientific American and thereby cannot cure cancer. 
Step 4: Conclusion: The abstract refutes the claim in the news. The rationale is this sentence: “The very concept that diseases… disproven by the Scientific American (Citation7,Citation8).”

Claim: U.S. carrots are 'soaked' in bleach, chlorpropham is used.
Abstract: World over, potatoes are being stored at 8-12 ¬∞C (85-90 % RH). This is the most common way of long-term (up to 6 to 9 months) storage of potatoes. The benefit of storing the potatoes within the temperature range of 8-12 ¬∞C is minimum accumulation of sugars in stored potato tubers. In sub-temperate, sub-tropical and tropical countries of the world, short-term (3 to 4 months) storage of potatoes is being done by non-refrigerated traditional/on-farm methods. These short- and long-term storage methods keep the stored potatoes suitable not only for table purpose but also for processing. However, once the natural dormancy period of potato is over, the prevailing temperatures in these storage methods favour sprouting and sprout growth. Therefore, use of some sprout suppressant to check the sprout growth becomes essential under these methods of potato storage. CIPC [Isopropyl N-(3-chlorophenyl) carbamate] is the most wide spread and commonly used sprout suppressant on potatoes. CIPC has been in use for more than 50 years and research carried out over such a long period use of CIPC has not only enhanced our understanding of its properties and chemistry but also about the production and toxicological status of its metabolites/degradation products. Today, various safety issues and concerns have surfaced primarily due to continuous and long-term use of CIPC. This review presents an appraisal on CIPC and explains the reasons for the long-time dependence on this chemical as a potato sprout suppressant. Issues like maximum residue limit and acceptable daily intake limit are being discussed for CIPC. This article brings an update on practical aspects of potato storage, residue levels of CIPC, efficacy of CIPC as sprout suppressant and health and environmental safety issues linked with CIPC and its metabolites. The aim of this article is to find possible solutions, way outs and future plans that can make the sprout suppression of potatoes safer and more risk free.

Claim: Unvaccinated people are more susceptible to catching COVID-19 than vaccinated people.
Abstract: The majority of vaccinated people who were admitted to hospital for covid-19 were probably infected shortly before or around the time of their vaccination, highlighting the importance of maintaining social distancing and understanding that immunity develops over time, researchers have said. The International Severe Acute Respiratory Infection Consortium Clinical Characterisation Protocol (ISARIC4C), which is funded by UK Research and Innovation and the National Institute for Health Research, analysed UK hospital admissions after the start of the covid-19 vaccination rollout. As of 10 April 2021, 3842 of the 99?445 inpatients enrolled in the study had been vaccinated. Looking at symptomatic patients (1823), the researchers found that 40% (729) developed covid-19 symptoms 0-7 days post-vaccination. A further 19% (352) developed symptoms 8-14 days post-vaccination. The median incubation period for SARS-CoV-2 is around five days, meaning it is likely that many of these patients were infected before immunity developed.

Claim: Updated CDC guidance on monkeypox transmission still includes 'respiratory transmission'.
Abstract: Planning a response to an outbreak of a pandemic strain of influenza is a high public health priority. Three research groups using different individual-based, stochastic simulation models have examined the consequences of intervention strategies chosen in consultation with U.S. public health workers. The first goal is to simulate the effectiveness of a set of potentially feasible intervention strategies. Combinations called targeted layered containment (TLC) of influenza antiviral treatment and prophylaxis and nonpharmaceutical interventions of quarantine, isolation, school closure, community social distancing, and workplace social distancing are considered. The second goal is to examine the robustness of the results to model assumptions. The comparisons focus on a pandemic outbreak in a population similar to that of Chicago, with ?8.6 million people. The simulations suggest that at the expected transmissibility of a pandemic strain, timely implementation of a combination of targeted household antiviral prophylaxis, and social distancing measures could substantially lower the illness attack rate before a highly efficacious vaccine could become available. Timely initiation of measures and school closure play important roles. Because of the current lack of data on which to base such models, further field research is recommended to learn more about the sources of transmission and the effectiveness of social distancing measures in reducing influenza transmission.

Claim: Sun exposure, and diet, causes skin cancers.
Abstract: Melanoma and keratinocyte skin cancer (KSC) are the most common types of cancer in White-skinned populations. Both tumor entities showed increasing incidence rates worldwide but stable or decreasing mortality rates. Rising incidence rates of cutaneous melanoma (CM) and KSC are largely attributed to increasing exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, the main causal risk factor for skin cancer. Incidence rates of KSC, comprising of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), are much higher than that of melanoma. BCC development is mainly the cause of an intensive UV exposure in childhood and adolescence, while SCC development is related to chronic, cumulative UV exposure over decades. Although mortality is relatively low, KSC is an increasing problem for health care services causing significant morbidity. Cutaneous melanoma is rapidly increasing in White populations, with an estimated annual increase of around 3-7% over the past decades. In contrast to SCC, melanoma risk is associated with intermittent and chronic exposure to sunlight. The frequency of its occurrence is closely associated with the constitutive color of the skin and the geographical zone. Changes in outdoor activities and exposure to sunlight during the past 70 years are an important factor for the increasing incidence of melanoma. Mortality rates of melanoma show stabilization in the USA, Australia, and in European countries. In the USA even dropping numbers of death cases were recently reported, probably reflecting efficacy of the new systemic treatments. Among younger cohorts in some populations (e.g., Australia and New Zealand,), stabilizing or declining incidence rates of CM are observed, potentially caused by primary prevention campaigns aimed at reducing UV exposure. In contrast, incidence rates of CM are still rising in most European countries and in the USA. Ongoing trends towards thinner melanoma are largely ascribed to earlier detection.

The rationale in this sentence is: “Among younger cohorts in some populations (e.g., Australia and New Zealand), stabilizing or declining incidence rates of CM [cutaneous melanoma] are observed, potentially caused by primary prevention campaigns aimed at reducing UV exposure.""

Claim: Targeting cancer cells with resonant frequencies has been shown to 'cure' cancer.
Abstract: In the 1920s and 1930s, Royal Raymond Rife developed special microscopes. Using these he claimed he could visualize living microorganisms, including viruses too small to be seen with any other existing technology, via the color of auras emitted as they vibrated (Citation1). In a 1961 deposition he explained this as follows: A special risley prism which works on a counter rotation principle selects a portion of the light frequency which illuminates these viruses in their own characteristic chemical colors by emission of coordinative light frequency and the viruses become readily identifiable by the colors revealed on observation. (Citation2). Several of his microscopes still exist. Their principles and alleged function have never been validated, and they have never been adopted for use. Rife went on to postulate that the microorganisms he was seeing were involved in human diseases, including cancer (Citation3-6). He invented a machine that he claimed could transmit radio frequency energy into a person and vibrate these microorganisms at a mortal oscillatory rate, thereby killing them and improving the disease they were causing (Citation3-6). Rife's claims were based upon his microscopic evaluations, which again do not appear to be legitimate. The very concept that diseases can be cured by radio frequency energy, originally proposed by Albert Abrams and referred to as 'radionics' (Citation7), was later investigated and disproven by the Scientific American (Citation7,Citation8). Nonetheless, there remain those who believe in Rife's work, claim it was suppressed as part of an elaborate conspiracy (Citation9) and continue to sell similar energy-transmitting devices (Citation10-12). Here, on behalf of PALS who asked about it, we review the potential use of the Rife Machine for ALS.

Claim: COVID-19 vaccines will kill people by causing antibody-dependent enhancement
Abstract: After Israel's national campaign vaccinated more than three-fourths of adults 70 years or older against SARS-CoV-2, the need for mechanical ventilation among patients with COVID-19 in that age group declined dramatically. The country's vaccination campaign began in December 2020 by prioritizing adults 60 years or older, health care workers, and those whose chronic medical conditions increased their risk of severe COVID-19. By February, 84% of adults 70 years or older had received 2 doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. To determine whether the vaccinations prevented severe disease, researchers calculated the ratio of patients aged 70 years or older to those aged 50 years or younger with COVID-19 who required mechanical ventilation. The younger group was chosen as a comparator because its 2-dose vaccination coverage was only about 10% as of February.
Question: Does the abstract of the scientific paper support the claim?

","Answer: Step 1: Read the whole abstract and extract information relevant to the question. The abstract discusses Israel's national vaccination campaign against SARS-CoV-2, which prioritized adults 60 years or older, health care workers, and those with chronic medical conditions. By February, 84% of adults 70 years or older had received two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. The need for mechanical ventilation among patients with COVID-19 in that age group declined dramatically after the vaccination campaign.
Step 2: Identify the relevant statement: “After Israel's national campaign vaccinated more than three-fourths of adults 70 years or older against SARS-CoV-2, the need for mechanical ventilation among patients with COVID-19 in that age group declined dramatically.”
Step 3: Give reasoning to rationalize your decision: The abstract provides evidence that the vaccination campaign in Israel, which used the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, resulted in a significant decrease in the need for mechanical ventilation among patients with COVID-19 who were 70 years or older. This suggests that the vaccine was effective in preventing severe disease in this age group.
Step 4: Conclusion: The abstract refutes the claim in the scientific news. The rationale in this sentence is: “After Israel's national campaign vaccinated more than three-fourths of adults 70 years or older against SARS-CoV-2, the need for mechanical ventilation among patients with COVID-19 in that age group declined dramatically.”"

Claim: Updated CDC guidance on monkeypox transmission still includes 'respiratory transmission'.
Abstract: Planning a response to an outbreak of a pandemic strain of influenza is a high public health priority. Three research groups using different individual-based, stochastic simulation models have examined the consequences of intervention strategies chosen in consultation with U.S. public health workers. The first goal is to simulate the effectiveness of a set of potentially feasible intervention strategies. Combinations called targeted layered containment (TLC) of influenza antiviral treatment and prophylaxis and nonpharmaceutical interventions of quarantine, isolation, school closure, community social distancing, and workplace social distancing are considered. The second goal is to examine the robustness of the results to model assumptions. The comparisons focus on a pandemic outbreak in a population similar to that of Chicago, with ?8.6 million people. The simulations suggest that at the expected transmissibility of a pandemic strain, timely implementation of a combination of targeted household antiviral prophylaxis, and social distancing measures could substantially lower the illness attack rate before a highly efficacious vaccine could become available. Timely initiation of measures and school closure play important roles. Because of the current lack of data on which to base such models, further field research is recommended to learn more about the sources of transmission and the effectiveness of social distancing measures in reducing influenza transmission.

Claim: Sun exposure, and diet, causes skin cancers.
Abstract: Melanoma and keratinocyte skin cancer (KSC) are the most common types of cancer in White-skinned populations. Both tumor entities showed increasing incidence rates worldwide but stable or decreasing mortality rates. Rising incidence rates of cutaneous melanoma (CM) and KSC are largely attributed to increasing exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, the main causal risk factor for skin cancer. Incidence rates of KSC, comprising of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), are much higher than that of melanoma. BCC development is mainly the cause of an intensive UV exposure in childhood and adolescence, while SCC development is related to chronic, cumulative UV exposure over decades. Although mortality is relatively low, KSC is an increasing problem for health care services causing significant morbidity. Cutaneous melanoma is rapidly increasing in White populations, with an estimated annual increase of around 3-7% over the past decades. In contrast to SCC, melanoma risk is associated with intermittent and chronic exposure to sunlight. The frequency of its occurrence is closely associated with the constitutive color of the skin and the geographical zone. Changes in outdoor activities and exposure to sunlight during the past 70 years are an important factor for the increasing incidence of melanoma. Mortality rates of melanoma show stabilization in the USA, Australia, and in European countries. In the USA even dropping numbers of death cases were recently reported, probably reflecting efficacy of the new systemic treatments. Among younger cohorts in some populations (e.g., Australia and New Zealand,), stabilizing or declining incidence rates of CM are observed, potentially caused by primary prevention campaigns aimed at reducing UV exposure. In contrast, incidence rates of CM are still rising in most European countries and in the USA. Ongoing trends towards thinner melanoma are largely ascribed to earlier detection.
Question: Does the abstract of the scientific paper support the claim?

Answer: Step 1: Read the whole abstract and extract information relevant to the question. The abstract highlights that melanoma and keratinocyte skin cancer (KSC) are the most common types of cancer in White-skinned populations, with increasing incidence rates worldwide but stable or decreasing mortality rates. The rising incidence rates are largely attributed to increasing exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Incidence rates of KSC, comprising basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), are much higher than that of melanoma. Additionally, it discusses the factors contributing to the development of BCC and SCC, as well as the risk factors associated with melanoma. Furthermore, it mentions the trends in mortality rates of melanoma, primary prevention campaigns aimed at reducing UV exposure, and ongoing trends towards thinner melanoma largely ascribed to earlier detection.
Step 2: Identify the relevant statement: “Among younger cohorts in some populations (e.g., Australia and New Zealand), stabilizing or declining incidence rates of CM [cutaneous melanoma] are observed, potentially caused by primary prevention campaigns aimed at reducing UV exposure.""
Step 3: Give reasoning to rationalize your decision: The stabilization or decline in CM rates in younger cohorts is attributed to successful primary prevention campaigns that aim to reduce UV exposure, indicating that targeted public health measures can effectively mitigate the rising trend of melanoma in specific demographics. 
Step 4: Conclusion: The abstract refutes the claim in the scientific news. The rationale in this sentence is: “Among younger cohorts in some populations (e.g., Australia and New Zealand), stabilizing or declining incidence rates of CM [cutaneous melanoma] are observed, potentially caused by primary prevention campaigns aimed at reducing UV exposure.""

Claim: Targeting cancer cells with resonant frequencies has been shown to 'cure' cancer.
Abstract: In the 1920s and 1930s, Royal Raymond Rife developed special microscopes. Using these he claimed he could visualize living microorganisms, including viruses too small to be seen with any other existing technology, via the color of auras emitted as they vibrated (Citation1). In a 1961 deposition he explained this as follows: A special risley prism which works on a counter rotation principle selects a portion of the light frequency which illuminates these viruses in their own characteristic chemical colors by emission of coordinative light frequency and the viruses become readily identifiable by the colors revealed on observation. (Citation2). Several of his microscopes still exist. Their principles and alleged function have never been validated, and they have never been adopted for use. Rife went on to postulate that the microorganisms he was seeing were involved in human diseases, including cancer (Citation3-6). He invented a machine that he claimed could transmit radio frequency energy into a person and vibrate these microorganisms at a mortal oscillatory rate, thereby killing them and improving the disease they were causing (Citation3-6). Rife's claims were based upon his microscopic evaluations, which again do not appear to be legitimate. The very concept that diseases can be cured by radio frequency energy, originally proposed by Albert Abrams and referred to as 'radionics' (Citation7), was later investigated and disproven by the Scientific American (Citation7,Citation8). Nonetheless, there remain those who believe in Rife's work, claim it was suppressed as part of an elaborate conspiracy (Citation9) and continue to sell similar energy-transmitting devices (Citation10-12). Here, on behalf of PALS who asked about it, we review the potential use of the Rife Machine for ALS.

Claim: U.S. carrots are 'soaked' in bleach, chlorpropham is used.
Abstract: World over, potatoes are being stored at 8-12 ¬∞C (85-90 % RH). This is the most common way of long-term (up to 6 to 9 months) storage of potatoes. The benefit of storing the potatoes within the temperature range of 8-12 ¬∞C is minimum accumulation of sugars in stored potato tubers. In sub-temperate, sub-tropical and tropical countries of the world, short-term (3 to 4 months) storage of potatoes is being done by non-refrigerated traditional/on-farm methods. These short- and long-term storage methods keep the stored potatoes suitable not only for table purpose but also for processing. However, once the natural dormancy period of potato is over, the prevailing temperatures in these storage methods favour sprouting and sprout growth. Therefore, use of some sprout suppressant to check the sprout growth becomes essential under these methods of potato storage. CIPC [Isopropyl N-(3-chlorophenyl) carbamate] is the most wide spread and commonly used sprout suppressant on potatoes. CIPC has been in use for more than 50 years and research carried out over such a long period use of CIPC has not only enhanced our understanding of its properties and chemistry but also about the production and toxicological status of its metabolites/degradation products. Today, various safety issues and concerns have surfaced primarily due to continuous and long-term use of CIPC. This review presents an appraisal on CIPC and explains the reasons for the long-time dependence on this chemical as a potato sprout suppressant. Issues like maximum residue limit and acceptable daily intake limit are being discussed for CIPC. This article brings an update on practical aspects of potato storage, residue levels of CIPC, efficacy of CIPC as sprout suppressant and health and environmental safety issues linked with CIPC and its metabolites. The aim of this article is to find possible solutions, way outs and future plans that can make the sprout suppression of potatoes safer and more risk free.

The frequency of its occurrence is closely associated with the constitutive color of the skin and the geographical zone. Changes in outdoor activities and exposure to sunlight during the past 70 years are an important factor for the increasing incidence of melanoma. Mortality rates of melanoma show stabilization in the USA, Australia, and in European countries. In the USA even dropping numbers of death cases were recently reported, probably reflecting efficacy of the new systemic treatments. Among younger cohorts in some populations (e.g., Australia and New Zealand,), stabilizing or declining incidence rates of CM are observed, potentially caused by primary prevention campaigns aimed at reducing UV exposure. In contrast, incidence rates of CM are still rising in most European countries and in the USA. Ongoing trends towards thinner melanoma are largely ascribed to earlier detection.
Question: Does the abstract of the scientific paper support the claim?

Answer: Step 1: Read the whole abstract and extract information relevant to the question. The abstract highlights that melanoma and keratinocyte skin cancer (KSC) are the most common types of cancer in White-skinned populations, with increasing incidence rates worldwide but stable or decreasing mortality rates. The rising incidence rates are largely attributed to increasing exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Incidence rates of KSC, comprising basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), are much higher than that of melanoma. Additionally, it discusses the factors contributing to the development of BCC and SCC, as well as the risk factors associated with melanoma. Furthermore, it mentions the trends in mortality rates of melanoma, primary prevention campaigns aimed at reducing UV exposure, and ongoing trends towards thinner melanoma largely ascribed to earlier detection.
Step 2: Identify the relevant statement: “Among younger cohorts in some populations (e.g., Australia and New Zealand), stabilizing or declining incidence rates of CM [cutaneous melanoma] are observed, potentially caused by primary prevention campaigns aimed at reducing UV exposure.""
Step 3: Give reasoning to rationalize your decision: The stabilization or decline in CM rates in younger cohorts is attributed to successful primary prevention campaigns that aim to reduce UV exposure, indicating that targeted public health measures can effectively mitigate the rising trend of melanoma in specific demographics. 
Step 4: Conclusion: The abstract refutes the claim in the scientific news. The rationale in this sentence is: “Among younger cohorts in some populations (e.g., Australia and New Zealand), stabilizing or declining incidence rates of CM [cutaneous melanoma] are observed, potentially caused by primary prevention campaigns aimed at reducing UV exposure.""

Claim: Targeting cancer cells with resonant frequencies has been shown to 'cure' cancer.
Abstract: In the 1920s and 1930s, Royal Raymond Rife developed special microscopes. Using these he claimed he could visualize living microorganisms, including viruses too small to be seen with any other existing technology, via the color of auras emitted as they vibrated (Citation1). In a 1961 deposition he explained this as follows: A special risley prism which works on a counter rotation principle selects a portion of the light frequency which illuminates these viruses in their own characteristic chemical colors by emission of coordinative light frequency and the viruses become readily identifiable by the colors revealed on observation. (Citation2). Several of his microscopes still exist. Their principles and alleged function have never been validated, and they have never been adopted for use. Rife went on to postulate that the microorganisms he was seeing were involved in human diseases, including cancer (Citation3-6). He invented a machine that he claimed could transmit radio frequency energy into a person and vibrate these microorganisms at a mortal oscillatory rate, thereby killing them and improving the disease they were causing (Citation3-6). Rife's claims were based upon his microscopic evaluations, which again do not appear to be legitimate. The very concept that diseases can be cured by radio frequency energy, originally proposed by Albert Abrams and referred to as 'radionics' (Citation7), was later investigated and disproven by the Scientific American (Citation7,Citation8). Nonetheless, there remain those who believe in Rife's work, claim it was suppressed as part of an elaborate conspiracy (Citation9) and continue to sell similar energy-transmitting devices (Citation10-12). Here, on behalf of PALS who asked about it, we review the potential use of the Rife Machine for ALS.

Step 3: Give reasoning to rationalize your decision: Radionics has previously been investigated and disproved in research conducted by Scientific American and thereby cannot cure cancer. 
Step 4: Conclusion: The abstract refutes the claim in the news. The rationale is this sentence: “The very concept that diseases… disproven by the Scientific American (Citation7,Citation8).”

Claim: U.S. carrots are 'soaked' in bleach, chlorpropham is used.
Abstract: World over, potatoes are being stored at 8-12 ¬∞C (85-90 % RH). This is the most common way of long-term (up to 6 to 9 months) storage of potatoes. The benefit of storing the potatoes within the temperature range of 8-12 ¬∞C is minimum accumulation of sugars in stored potato tubers. In sub-temperate, sub-tropical and tropical countries of the world, short-term (3 to 4 months) storage of potatoes is being done by non-refrigerated traditional/on-farm methods. These short- and long-term storage methods keep the stored potatoes suitable not only for table purpose but also for processing. However, once the natural dormancy period of potato is over, the prevailing temperatures in these storage methods favour sprouting and sprout growth. Therefore, use of some sprout suppressant to check the sprout growth becomes essential under these methods of potato storage. CIPC [Isopropyl N-(3-chlorophenyl) carbamate] is the most wide spread and commonly used sprout suppressant on potatoes. CIPC has been in use for more than 50 years and research carried out over such a long period use of CIPC has not only enhanced our understanding of its properties and chemistry but also about the production and toxicological status of its metabolites/degradation products. Today, various safety issues and concerns have surfaced primarily due to continuous and long-term use of CIPC. This review presents an appraisal on CIPC and explains the reasons for the long-time dependence on this chemical as a potato sprout suppressant. Issues like maximum residue limit and acceptable daily intake limit are being discussed for CIPC. This article brings an update on practical aspects of potato storage, residue levels of CIPC, efficacy of CIPC as sprout suppressant and health and environmental safety issues linked with CIPC and its metabolites. The aim of this article is to find possible solutions, way outs and future plans that can make the sprout suppression of potatoes safer and more risk free.

Claim: Updated CDC guidance on monkeypox transmission still includes 'respiratory transmission'.
Abstract: Planning a response to an outbreak of a pandemic strain of influenza is a high public health priority. Three research groups using different individual-based, stochastic simulation models have examined the consequences of intervention strategies chosen in consultation with U.S. public health workers. The first goal is to simulate the effectiveness of a set of potentially feasible intervention strategies. Combinations called targeted layered containment (TLC) of influenza antiviral treatment and prophylaxis and nonpharmaceutical interventions of quarantine, isolation, school closure, community social distancing, and workplace social distancing are considered. The second goal is to examine the robustness of the results to model assumptions. The comparisons focus on a pandemic outbreak in a population similar to that of Chicago, with ?8.6 million people. The simulations suggest that at the expected transmissibility of a pandemic strain, timely implementation of a combination of targeted household antiviral prophylaxis, and social distancing measures could substantially lower the illness attack rate before a highly efficacious vaccine could become available. Timely initiation of measures and school closure play important roles. Because of the current lack of data on which to base such models, further field research is recommended to learn more about the sources of transmission and the effectiveness of social distancing measures in reducing influenza transmission.

Claim: Sun exposure, and diet, causes skin cancers.
Abstract: Melanoma and keratinocyte skin cancer (KSC) are the most common types of cancer in White-skinned populations. Both tumor entities showed increasing incidence rates worldwide but stable or decreasing mortality rates. Rising incidence rates of cutaneous melanoma (CM) and KSC are largely attributed to increasing exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, the main causal risk factor for skin cancer. Incidence rates of KSC, comprising of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), are much higher than that of melanoma. BCC development is mainly the cause of an intensive UV exposure in childhood and adolescence, while SCC development is related to chronic, cumulative UV exposure over decades. Although mortality is relatively low, KSC is an increasing problem for health care services causing significant morbidity. Cutaneous melanoma is rapidly increasing in White populations, with an estimated annual increase of around 3-7% over the past decades. In contrast to SCC, melanoma risk is associated with intermittent and chronic exposure to sunlight.

Claim: mRNA vaccines reduce life expectancy or cause severe health issues.
Abstract: By the end of January 2021, more than 97.3 million doses globally and 31.8 million doses in the United States have been administered of the COVID-19 vaccine.1 Although important postmarketing surveillance is ongoing, it is currently highly effective and safe, with adverse effects including transient symptoms such as fever/chills, headache, fatigue, myalgia/arthralgia, lymphadenopathy, nausea, or local effects of swelling, erythema, or pain.2 With the public being vaccinated, there have recently been videos circulating on social media about major neurologic adverse events after administration of the COVID-19 vaccine.3 A few of these videos have been viewed millions of times by the public.3 Some depict individuals with continuous movements of the trunk and limbs or walking difficulties. The spread of these videos has fueled vaccine hesitancy concerns and without effective communication by medical professionals to the public, this can lead to reduced vaccination rates and an unnecessary prolongation of the pandemic. It must be noted that these videos may be unsubstantiated, and it is not definitively known if the COVID-19 vaccine was administered in these cases. However, it was reported in the news that at least 1 patient was told by their physician that the diagnosis was conversion disorder,4 also known as functional neurological disorder (FND). Here, we provide context regarding potential associations between FND and COVID-19 vaccinations, as effective communication regarding this intersection is critically important.

Rife claimed that these microscopes could visualize living microorganisms, including viruses, and that the colors emitted by these microorganisms allowed for their identification. Rife proposed that the microorganisms he observed were involved in human diseases, such as cancer, and invented a machine that he claimed could transmit radio frequency energy to kill these microorganisms and improve the associated diseases. However, Rife's claims and the concept of curing diseases with radio frequency energy have not been validated and were later disproven. Despite this, there are still people who believe in Rife's work and sell similar energy-transmitting devices.
Step 2: Identify the relevant statement: “The very concept that diseases can be cured by radio frequency energy, originally proposed by Albert Abrams and referred to as 'radionics' (Citation7), was later investigated and disproven by the Scientific American (Citation7,Citation8).”
Step 3: Give reasoning to rationalize your decision: Radionics has previously been investigated and disproved in research conducted by Scientific American and thereby cannot cure cancer. 
Step 4: Conclusion: The abstract refutes the claim in the news. The rationale is this sentence: “The very concept that diseases… disproven by the Scientific American (Citation7,Citation8).”

Claim: U.S. carrots are 'soaked' in bleach, chlorpropham is used.
Abstract: World over, potatoes are being stored at 8-12 ¬∞C (85-90 % RH). This is the most common way of long-term (up to 6 to 9 months) storage of potatoes. The benefit of storing the potatoes within the temperature range of 8-12 ¬∞C is minimum accumulation of sugars in stored potato tubers. In sub-temperate, sub-tropical and tropical countries of the world, short-term (3 to 4 months) storage of potatoes is being done by non-refrigerated traditional/on-farm methods. These short- and long-term storage methods keep the stored potatoes suitable not only for table purpose but also for processing. However, once the natural dormancy period of potato is over, the prevailing temperatures in these storage methods favour sprouting and sprout growth. Therefore, use of some sprout suppressant to check the sprout growth becomes essential under these methods of potato storage. CIPC [Isopropyl N-(3-chlorophenyl) carbamate] is the most wide spread and commonly used sprout suppressant on potatoes. CIPC has been in use for more than 50 years and research carried out over such a long period use of CIPC has not only enhanced our understanding of its properties and chemistry but also about the production and toxicological status of its metabolites/degradation products. Today, various safety issues and concerns have surfaced primarily due to continuous and long-term use of CIPC. This review presents an appraisal on CIPC and explains the reasons for the long-time dependence on this chemical as a potato sprout suppressant. Issues like maximum residue limit and acceptable daily intake limit are being discussed for CIPC. This article brings an update on practical aspects of potato storage, residue levels of CIPC, efficacy of CIPC as sprout suppressant and health and environmental safety issues linked with CIPC and its metabolites. The aim of this article is to find possible solutions, way outs and future plans that can make the sprout suppression of potatoes safer and more risk free.

Claim: “ethylene oxide-coated” swabs in lateral flow tests cause cancer.
Abstract: Recent years have seen a significant increase in the sensitivity of DNA testing, enabling the determination of DNA profiles from low levels of cellular material. However, the increased sensitivity is in many ways a double-edged sword as background contaminating DNA generated during the manufacture of consumables and sampling devices is now being detected and may compromise the interpretation of the DNA profile results. This study initially demonstrated the effectiveness of ethylene oxide (EO) as a post-production treatment to eliminate DNA on swabs, used as a sampling device for the recovery of cellular material. Subsequently, the potential adverse effects of any residual EO remaining on the swabs on the downstream DNA analysis on both rayon and cotton swabs were investigated and the levels of remaining EO measured. Two main variables were tested: the amount of time elapsed since EO treatment of the swabs prior to use, and the time elapsed between cellular material collection and DNA analysis. Residual levels of EO were found to be below quantitation levels and therefore also international standards. The results indicated that while there was a negligible effect of EO treatment on DNA recovered from rayon swabs, there was however an adverse effect on the DNA profiles recovered from cotton swabs. The adverse effect was negatively correlated with time since EO treatment and positively correlated with time to DNA analysis.

Claim: Updated CDC guidance on monkeypox transmission still includes 'respiratory transmission'.
Abstract: Planning a response to an outbreak of a pandemic strain of influenza is a high public health priority. Three research groups using different individual-based, stochastic simulation models have examined the consequences of intervention strategies chosen in consultation with U.S. public health workers. The first goal is to simulate the effectiveness of a set of potentially feasible intervention strategies. Combinations called targeted layered containment (TLC) of influenza antiviral treatment and prophylaxis and nonpharmaceutical interventions of quarantine, isolation, school closure, community social distancing, and workplace social distancing are considered. The second goal is to examine the robustness of the results to model assumptions. The comparisons focus on a pandemic outbreak in a population similar to that of Chicago, with ?8.6 million people. The simulations suggest that at the expected transmissibility of a pandemic strain, timely implementation of a combination of targeted household antiviral prophylaxis, and social distancing measures could substantially lower the illness attack rate before a highly efficacious vaccine could become available. Timely initiation of measures and school closure play important roles. Because of the current lack of data on which to base such models, further field research is recommended to learn more about the sources of transmission and the effectiveness of social distancing measures in reducing influenza transmission.

Claim: Sun exposure, and diet, causes skin cancers.
Abstract: Melanoma and keratinocyte skin cancer (KSC) are the most common types of cancer in White-skinned populations. Both tumor entities showed increasing incidence rates worldwide but stable or decreasing mortality rates. Rising incidence rates of cutaneous melanoma (CM) and KSC are largely attributed to increasing exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, the main causal risk factor for skin cancer. Incidence rates of KSC, comprising of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), are much higher than that of melanoma. BCC development is mainly the cause of an intensive UV exposure in childhood and adolescence, while SCC development is related to chronic, cumulative UV exposure over decades. Although mortality is relatively low, KSC is an increasing problem for health care services causing significant morbidity. Cutaneous melanoma is rapidly increasing in White populations, with an estimated annual increase of around 3-7% over the past decades. In contrast to SCC, melanoma risk is associated with intermittent and chronic exposure to sunlight. The frequency of its occurrence is closely associated with the constitutive color of the skin and the geographical zone. Changes in outdoor activities and exposure to sunlight during the past 70 years are an important factor for the increasing incidence of melanoma. Mortality rates of melanoma show stabilization in the USA, Australia, and in European countries. In the USA even dropping numbers of death cases were recently reported, probably reflecting efficacy of the new systemic treatments. Among younger cohorts in some populations (e.g., Australia and New Zealand,), stabilizing or declining incidence rates of CM are observed, potentially caused by primary prevention campaigns aimed at reducing UV exposure. In contrast, incidence rates of CM are still rising in most European countries and in the USA. Ongoing trends towards thinner melanoma are largely ascribed to earlier detection.

The rationale in this sentence is: “Among younger cohorts in some populations (e.g., Australia and New Zealand), stabilizing or declining incidence rates of CM [cutaneous melanoma] are observed, potentially caused by primary prevention campaigns aimed at reducing UV exposure.""

Claim: Targeting cancer cells with resonant frequencies has been shown to 'cure' cancer.
Abstract: In the 1920s and 1930s, Royal Raymond Rife developed special microscopes. Using these he claimed he could visualize living microorganisms, including viruses too small to be seen with any other existing technology, via the color of auras emitted as they vibrated (Citation1). In a 1961 deposition he explained this as follows: A special risley prism which works on a counter rotation principle selects a portion of the light frequency which illuminates these viruses in their own characteristic chemical colors by emission of coordinative light frequency and the viruses become readily identifiable by the colors revealed on observation. (Citation2). Several of his microscopes still exist. Their principles and alleged function have never been validated, and they have never been adopted for use. Rife went on to postulate that the microorganisms he was seeing were involved in human diseases, including cancer (Citation3-6). He invented a machine that he claimed could transmit radio frequency energy into a person and vibrate these microorganisms at a mortal oscillatory rate, thereby killing them and improving the disease they were causing (Citation3-6). Rife's claims were based upon his microscopic evaluations, which again do not appear to be legitimate. The very concept that diseases can be cured by radio frequency energy, originally proposed by Albert Abrams and referred to as 'radionics' (Citation7), was later investigated and disproven by the Scientific American (Citation7,Citation8). Nonetheless, there remain those who believe in Rife's work, claim it was suppressed as part of an elaborate conspiracy (Citation9) and continue to sell similar energy-transmitting devices (Citation10-12). Here, on behalf of PALS who asked about it, we review the potential use of the Rife Machine for ALS.

Claim: Asymptomatic people can't infect others with COVID-19
Abstract: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiology of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is readily transmitted person to person. Optimal control of COVID-19 depends on directing resources and health messaging to mitigation efforts that are most likely to prevent transmission, but the relative importance of such measures has been disputed. In this decision analytical model of multiple scenarios of proportions of asymptomatic individuals with COVID-19 and infectious periods, transmission from asymptomatic individuals was estimated to account for more than half of all transmissions. In addition to identification and isolation of persons with symptomatic COVID-19, effective control of spread will require reducing the risk of transmission from people with infection who do not have symptoms. These findings suggest that measures such as wearing masks, hand hygiene, social distancing, and strategic testing of people who are not ill will be foundational to slowing the spread of COVID-19 until safe and effective vaccines are available and widely used.

Abstract: In the past 25 years, virology has had major technology breakthroughs stemming first from the introduction of nucleic acid amplification testing, but more recently from the use of next-generation sequencing, digital PCR, and the possibility of single virion genomics. These technologies have and will improve diagnosis and disease state monitoring in clinical settings, aid in environmental monitoring, and reveal the vast genetic potential of viruses. Using the principle of limiting dilution, digital PCR amplifies single molecules of DNA in highly partitioned endpoint reactions and reads each of those reactions as either positive or negative based on the presence or absence of target fluorophore. In this review, digital PCR will be highlighted along with current studies, advantages/disadvantages, and future perspectives with regard to digital PCR, viral load testing, and the possibility of single virion genomics.

Claim: Updated CDC guidance on monkeypox transmission still includes 'respiratory transmission'.
Abstract: Planning a response to an outbreak of a pandemic strain of influenza is a high public health priority. Three research groups using different individual-based, stochastic simulation models have examined the consequences of intervention strategies chosen in consultation with U.S. public health workers. The first goal is to simulate the effectiveness of a set of potentially feasible intervention strategies. Combinations called targeted layered containment (TLC) of influenza antiviral treatment and prophylaxis and nonpharmaceutical interventions of quarantine, isolation, school closure, community social distancing, and workplace social distancing are considered. The second goal is to examine the robustness of the results to model assumptions. The comparisons focus on a pandemic outbreak in a population similar to that of Chicago, with ?8.6 million people. The simulations suggest that at the expected transmissibility of a pandemic strain, timely implementation of a combination of targeted household antiviral prophylaxis, and social distancing measures could substantially lower the illness attack rate before a highly efficacious vaccine could become available. Timely initiation of measures and school closure play important roles. Because of the current lack of data on which to base such models, further field research is recommended to learn more about the sources of transmission and the effectiveness of social distancing measures in reducing influenza transmission.

Claim: Sun exposure, and diet, causes skin cancers.
Abstract: Melanoma and keratinocyte skin cancer (KSC) are the most common types of cancer in White-skinned populations. Both tumor entities showed increasing incidence rates worldwide but stable or decreasing mortality rates. Rising incidence rates of cutaneous melanoma (CM) and KSC are largely attributed to increasing exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, the main causal risk factor for skin cancer. Incidence rates of KSC, comprising of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), are much higher than that of melanoma. BCC development is mainly the cause of an intensive UV exposure in childhood and adolescence, while SCC development is related to chronic, cumulative UV exposure over decades. Although mortality is relatively low, KSC is an increasing problem for health care services causing significant morbidity. Cutaneous melanoma is rapidly increasing in White populations, with an estimated annual increase of around 3-7% over the past decades. In contrast to SCC, melanoma risk is associated with intermittent and chronic exposure to sunlight. The frequency of its occurrence is closely associated with the constitutive color of the skin and the geographical zone. Changes in outdoor activities and exposure to sunlight during the past 70 years are an important factor for the increasing incidence of melanoma. Mortality rates of melanoma show stabilization in the USA, Australia, and in European countries. In the USA even dropping numbers of death cases were recently reported, probably reflecting efficacy of the new systemic treatments. Among younger cohorts in some populations (e.g., Australia and New Zealand,), stabilizing or declining incidence rates of CM are observed, potentially caused by primary prevention campaigns aimed at reducing UV exposure. In contrast, incidence rates of CM are still rising in most European countries and in the USA. Ongoing trends towards thinner melanoma are largely ascribed to earlier detection.

Claim: Targeting cancer cells with resonant frequencies has been shown to 'cure' cancer.
Abstract: In the 1920s and 1930s, Royal Raymond Rife developed special microscopes. Using these he claimed he could visualize living microorganisms, including viruses too small to be seen with any other existing technology, via the color of auras emitted as they vibrated (Citation1). In a 1961 deposition he explained this as follows: A special risley prism which works on a counter rotation principle selects a portion of the light frequency which illuminates these viruses in their own characteristic chemical colors by emission of coordinative light frequency and the viruses become readily identifiable by the colors revealed on observation. (Citation2). Several of his microscopes still exist. Their principles and alleged function have never been validated, and they have never been adopted for use. Rife went on to postulate that the microorganisms he was seeing were involved in human diseases, including cancer (Citation3-6). He invented a machine that he claimed could transmit radio frequency energy into a person and vibrate these microorganisms at a mortal oscillatory rate, thereby killing them and improving the disease they were causing (Citation3-6). Rife's claims were based upon his microscopic evaluations, which again do not appear to be legitimate. The very concept that diseases can be cured by radio frequency energy, originally proposed by Albert Abrams and referred to as 'radionics' (Citation7), was later investigated and disproven by the Scientific American (Citation7,Citation8). Nonetheless, there remain those who believe in Rife's work, claim it was suppressed as part of an elaborate conspiracy (Citation9) and continue to sell similar energy-transmitting devices (Citation10-12). Here, on behalf of PALS who asked about it, we review the potential use of the Rife Machine for ALS.

Claim: U.S. carrots are 'soaked' in bleach, chlorpropham is used.
Abstract: World over, potatoes are being stored at 8-12 ¬∞C (85-90 % RH). This is the most common way of long-term (up to 6 to 9 months) storage of potatoes. The benefit of storing the potatoes within the temperature range of 8-12 ¬∞C is minimum accumulation of sugars in stored potato tubers. In sub-temperate, sub-tropical and tropical countries of the world, short-term (3 to 4 months) storage of potatoes is being done by non-refrigerated traditional/on-farm methods. These short- and long-term storage methods keep the stored potatoes suitable not only for table purpose but also for processing. However, once the natural dormancy period of potato is over, the prevailing temperatures in these storage methods favour sprouting and sprout growth. Therefore, use of some sprout suppressant to check the sprout growth becomes essential under these methods of potato storage. CIPC [Isopropyl N-(3-chlorophenyl) carbamate] is the most wide spread and commonly used sprout suppressant on potatoes. CIPC has been in use for more than 50 years and research carried out over such a long period use of CIPC has not only enhanced our understanding of its properties and chemistry but also about the production and toxicological status of its metabolites/degradation products. Today, various safety issues and concerns have surfaced primarily due to continuous and long-term use of CIPC. This review presents an appraisal on CIPC and explains the reasons for the long-time dependence on this chemical as a potato sprout suppressant. Issues like maximum residue limit and acceptable daily intake limit are being discussed for CIPC. This article brings an update on practical aspects of potato storage, residue levels of CIPC, efficacy of CIPC as sprout suppressant and health and environmental safety issues linked with CIPC and its metabolites. The aim of this article is to find possible solutions, way outs and future plans that can make the sprout suppression of potatoes safer and more risk free.

Claim: Red Bull and Bang energy drinks test positive for various illicit and prescription drugs.
Abstract: Drug testing, commonly used in health care, workplace, and criminal settings, has become widespread during the past decade. Urine drug screens have been the most common method for analysis because of ease of sampling. The simplicity of use and access to rapid results have increased demand for and use of immunoassays; however, these assays are not perfect. False-positive results of immunoassays can lead to serious medical or social consequences if results are not confirmed by secondary analysis, such as gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The Department of Health and Human Services' guidelines for the workplace require testing for the following 5 substances: amphetamines, cannabinoids, cocaine, opiates, and phencyclidine. This article discusses potential false-positive results and false-negative results that occur with immunoassays of these substances and with alcohol, benzodiazepines, and tricyclic antidepressants. Other pitfalls, such as adulteration, substitution, and dilution of urine samples, are discussed. Pragmatic concepts summarized in this article should minimize the potential risks of misinterpreting urine drug screens.

Claim: Every cell in the human body is replaced every seven years.
Abstract: Cataract is a visible opacity in the lens substance, which, when located on the visual axis, leads to visual loss. Age-related cataract is a cause of blindness on a global scale involving genetic and environmental influences. With ageing, lens proteins undergo non-enzymatic, post-translational modification and the accumulation of fluorescent chromophores, increasing susceptibility to oxidation and cross-linking and increased light-scatter. Because the human lens grows throughout life, the lens core is exposed for a longer period to such influences and the risk of oxidative damage increases in the fourth decade when a barrier to the transport of glutathione forms around the lens nucleus. Consequently, as the lens ages, its transparency falls and the nucleus becomes more rigid, resisting the change in shape necessary for accommodation. This is the basis of presbyopia. In some individuals, the steady accumulation of chromophores and complex, insoluble crystallin aggregates in the lens nucleus leads to the formation of a brown nuclear cataract. The process is homogeneous and the affected lens fibres retain their gross morphology. Cortical opacities are due to changes in membrane permeability and enzyme function and shear-stress damage to lens fibres with continued accommodative effort. Unlike nuclear cataract, progression is intermittent, stepwise and non-uniform.

Claim: Sun exposure, and diet, causes skin cancers.
Abstract: Melanoma and keratinocyte skin cancer (KSC) are the most common types of cancer in White-skinned populations. Both tumor entities showed increasing incidence rates worldwide but stable or decreasing mortality rates. Rising incidence rates of cutaneous melanoma (CM) and KSC are largely attributed to increasing exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, the main causal risk factor for skin cancer. Incidence rates of KSC, comprising of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), are much higher than that of melanoma. BCC development is mainly the cause of an intensive UV exposure in childhood and adolescence, while SCC development is related to chronic, cumulative UV exposure over decades. Although mortality is relatively low, KSC is an increasing problem for health care services causing significant morbidity. Cutaneous melanoma is rapidly increasing in White populations, with an estimated annual increase of around 3-7% over the past decades. In contrast to SCC, melanoma risk is associated with intermittent and chronic exposure to sunlight. The frequency of its occurrence is closely associated with the constitutive color of the skin and the geographical zone. Changes in outdoor activities and exposure to sunlight during the past 70 years are an important factor for the increasing incidence of melanoma. Mortality rates of melanoma show stabilization in the USA, Australia, and in European countries. In the USA even dropping numbers of death cases were recently reported, probably reflecting efficacy of the new systemic treatments. Among younger cohorts in some populations (e.g., Australia and New Zealand,), stabilizing or declining incidence rates of CM are observed, potentially caused by primary prevention campaigns aimed at reducing UV exposure. In contrast, incidence rates of CM are still rising in most European countries and in the USA. Ongoing trends towards thinner melanoma are largely ascribed to earlier detection.
Question: Does the abstract of the scientific paper support the claim?

Answer: Step 1: Read the whole abstract and extract information relevant to the question. The abstract highlights that melanoma and keratinocyte skin cancer (KSC) are the most common types of cancer in White-skinned populations, with increasing incidence rates worldwide but stable or decreasing mortality rates. The rising incidence rates are largely attributed to increasing exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Incidence rates of KSC, comprising basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), are much higher than that of melanoma. Additionally, it discusses the factors contributing to the development of BCC and SCC, as well as the risk factors associated with melanoma. Furthermore, it mentions the trends in mortality rates of melanoma, primary prevention campaigns aimed at reducing UV exposure, and ongoing trends towards thinner melanoma largely ascribed to earlier detection.
Step 2: Identify the relevant statement: “Among younger cohorts in some populations (e.g., Australia and New Zealand), stabilizing or declining incidence rates of CM [cutaneous melanoma] are observed, potentially caused by primary prevention campaigns aimed at reducing UV exposure.""
Step 3: Give reasoning to rationalize your decision: The stabilization or decline in CM rates in younger cohorts is attributed to successful primary prevention campaigns that aim to reduce UV exposure, indicating that targeted public health measures can effectively mitigate the rising trend of melanoma in specific demographics. 
Step 4: Conclusion: The abstract refutes the claim in the scientific news. The rationale in this sentence is: “Among younger cohorts in some populations (e.g., Australia and New Zealand), stabilizing or declining incidence rates of CM [cutaneous melanoma] are observed, potentially caused by primary prevention campaigns aimed at reducing UV exposure.""

Claim: Targeting cancer cells with resonant frequencies has been shown to 'cure' cancer.
Abstract: In the 1920s and 1930s, Royal Raymond Rife developed special microscopes. Using these he claimed he could visualize living microorganisms, including viruses too small to be seen with any other existing technology, via the color of auras emitted as they vibrated (Citation1). In a 1961 deposition he explained this as follows: A special risley prism which works on a counter rotation principle selects a portion of the light frequency which illuminates these viruses in their own characteristic chemical colors by emission of coordinative light frequency and the viruses become readily identifiable by the colors revealed on observation. (Citation2). Several of his microscopes still exist. Their principles and alleged function have never been validated, and they have never been adopted for use. Rife went on to postulate that the microorganisms he was seeing were involved in human diseases, including cancer (Citation3-6). He invented a machine that he claimed could transmit radio frequency energy into a person and vibrate these microorganisms at a mortal oscillatory rate, thereby killing them and improving the disease they were causing (Citation3-6). Rife's claims were based upon his microscopic evaluations, which again do not appear to be legitimate. The very concept that diseases can be cured by radio frequency energy, originally proposed by Albert Abrams and referred to as 'radionics' (Citation7), was later investigated and disproven by the Scientific American (Citation7,Citation8). Nonetheless, there remain those who believe in Rife's work, claim it was suppressed as part of an elaborate conspiracy (Citation9) and continue to sell similar energy-transmitting devices (Citation10-12). Here, on behalf of PALS who asked about it, we review the potential use of the Rife Machine for ALS.

Abstract: World over, potatoes are being stored at 8-12 ¬∞C (85-90 % RH). This is the most common way of long-term (up to 6 to 9 months) storage of potatoes. The benefit of storing the potatoes within the temperature range of 8-12 ¬∞C is minimum accumulation of sugars in stored potato tubers. In sub-temperate, sub-tropical and tropical countries of the world, short-term (3 to 4 months) storage of potatoes is being done by non-refrigerated traditional/on-farm methods. These short- and long-term storage methods keep the stored potatoes suitable not only for table purpose but also for processing. However, once the natural dormancy period of potato is over, the prevailing temperatures in these storage methods favour sprouting and sprout growth. Therefore, use of some sprout suppressant to check the sprout growth becomes essential under these methods of potato storage. CIPC [Isopropyl N-(3-chlorophenyl) carbamate] is the most wide spread and commonly used sprout suppressant on potatoes. CIPC has been in use for more than 50 years and research carried out over such a long period use of CIPC has not only enhanced our understanding of its properties and chemistry but also about the production and toxicological status of its metabolites/degradation products. Today, various safety issues and concerns have surfaced primarily due to continuous and long-term use of CIPC. This review presents an appraisal on CIPC and explains the reasons for the long-time dependence on this chemical as a potato sprout suppressant. Issues like maximum residue limit and acceptable daily intake limit are being discussed for CIPC. This article brings an update on practical aspects of potato storage, residue levels of CIPC, efficacy of CIPC as sprout suppressant and health and environmental safety issues linked with CIPC and its metabolites. The aim of this article is to find possible solutions, way outs and future plans that can make the sprout suppression of potatoes safer and more risk free.

Claim: Using toilet paper as a barrier between you and a toilet seat poses more health risks than just sitting down without a barrier.
Abstract: Fomites can serve as routes of transmission for both enteric and respiratory pathogens. The present study examined the effect of low and high relative humidity on fomite-to-finger transfer efficiency of five model organisms from several common inanimate surfaces (fomites). Nine fomites representing porous and nonporous surfaces of different compositions were studied. Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus thuringiensis, MS2 coliphage, and poliovirus 1 were placed on fomites in 10-?l drops and allowed to dry for 30 min under low (15% to 32%) or high (40% to 65%) relative humidity. Fomite-to-finger transfers were performed using 1.0 kg/cm(2) of pressure for 10 s. Transfer efficiencies were greater under high relative humidity for both porous and nonporous surfaces. Most organisms on average had greater transfer efficiencies under high relative humidity than under low relative humidity. Nonporous surfaces had a greater transfer efficiency (up to 57%) than porous surfaces (<6.8%) under low relative humidity, as well as under high relative humidity (nonporous, up to 79.5%; porous, <13.4%). Transfer efficiency also varied with fomite material and organism type. The data generated can be used in quantitative microbial risk assessment models to assess the risk of infection from fomite-transmitted human pathogens and the relative levels of exposure to different types of fomites and microorganisms.
Question: Does the abstract of the scientific paper support the claim?

","Answer: Step 1: Read the whole abstract and extract information relevant to the question. The abstract discusses the role of fomites in the transmission of both enteric and respiratory pathogens. It examines the effect of low and high relative humidity on the efficiency of fomite-to-finger transfer of five model organisms from several common inanimate surfaces. The study found that transfer efficiencies were greater under high relative humidity for both porous and nonporous surfaces. Most organisms had greater transfer efficiencies under high relative humidity than under low relative humidity. Nonporous surfaces had a greater transfer efficiency than porous surfaces under both low and high relative humidity. Transfer efficiency also varied with fomite material and organism type.
Step 2: Identify the relevant statement: “Transfer efficiencies were greater under high relative humidity for both porous and nonporous surfaces. Most organisms on average had greater transfer efficiencies under high relative humidity than under low relative humidity. Nonporous surfaces had a greater transfer efficiency (up to 57%) than porous surfaces (<6.8%) under low relative humidity, as well as under high relative humidity (nonporous, up to 79.5%; porous, <13.4%).”
Step 3: Give reasoning to rationalize your decision: The abstract discusses the transfer efficiency of organisms from fomites to fingers, which could be relevant to the claim about toilet paper (a porous surface) serving as a barrier on toilet seats (a nonporous surface). However, it does not specifically address the health risks associated with using toilet paper as a barrier on toilet seats.
Step 4: Conclusion: The abstract does not support or refute the claim in the scientific news. The rationale is that while the abstract provides information on the transfer efficiency of organisms from fomites to fingers under different conditions, it does not specifically address the use of toilet paper as a barrier on toilet seats."

Claim: Updated CDC guidance on monkeypox transmission still includes 'respiratory transmission'.
Abstract: Planning a response to an outbreak of a pandemic strain of influenza is a high public health priority. Three research groups using different individual-based, stochastic simulation models have examined the consequences of intervention strategies chosen in consultation with U.S. public health workers. The first goal is to simulate the effectiveness of a set of potentially feasible intervention strategies. Combinations called targeted layered containment (TLC) of influenza antiviral treatment and prophylaxis and nonpharmaceutical interventions of quarantine, isolation, school closure, community social distancing, and workplace social distancing are considered. The second goal is to examine the robustness of the results to model assumptions. The comparisons focus on a pandemic outbreak in a population similar to that of Chicago, with ?8.6 million people. The simulations suggest that at the expected transmissibility of a pandemic strain, timely implementation of a combination of targeted household antiviral prophylaxis, and social distancing measures could substantially lower the illness attack rate before a highly efficacious vaccine could become available. Timely initiation of measures and school closure play important roles. Because of the current lack of data on which to base such models, further field research is recommended to learn more about the sources of transmission and the effectiveness of social distancing measures in reducing influenza transmission.

Abstract: Allyl sulfides, e.g., diallyl sulfide (DAS), diallyl disulfide (DADS), and diallyl trisulfide (DATS), are principal constituents of garlic oil. In the present study, we investigated the in vivo effect of these sulfides on the phase I and phase II drug-metabolizing enzymes, and elucidated their structure-function relationship. A highly purified form of each sulfide (more than 99% purity) was administered i.p. as a bolus to rats at a concentration of 10 or 100 micromol/kg body weight for 14 consecutive days. As to the phase I enzymes, DAS (100 micromol/kg) slightly but significantly increased cytochrome P-450 (CYP) 2E1 activity (1.6-fold vs. control), whereas DADS and DATS did not affect it or the hepatic total CYP level or CYP1A1/2 activity. With respect to the phase II enzymes, DATS (10 micromol/kg) and DADS at a 10-fold higher dose (100 micromol/kg) significantly increased the activities of glutathione S-transferase, quinone reductase, and antioxidative enzyme glutathione peroxidase; whereas DAS did not. In the carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced acute liver injury model of rats, either DATS (10 micromol/kg) or DADS (100 micromol/kg) significantly reduced the injury caused by the induction of phase II enzymes with CCl4. In conclusion, the sulfides affected both phase I and phase II enzymes, the former being stimulated by the monosulfide only and the latter, strongly by the trisulfide and weakly by the disulfide. Therefore, the polysulfide DATS may be one of the important factors in garlic oil that protects our body against the injury caused by radical molecules encountered in daily life.

Claim: Targeting cancer cells with resonant frequencies has been shown to 'cure' cancer.
Abstract: In the 1920s and 1930s, Royal Raymond Rife developed special microscopes. Using these he claimed he could visualize living microorganisms, including viruses too small to be seen with any other existing technology, via the color of auras emitted as they vibrated (Citation1). In a 1961 deposition he explained this as follows: A special risley prism which works on a counter rotation principle selects a portion of the light frequency which illuminates these viruses in their own characteristic chemical colors by emission of coordinative light frequency and the viruses become readily identifiable by the colors revealed on observation. (Citation2). Several of his microscopes still exist. Their principles and alleged function have never been validated, and they have never been adopted for use. Rife went on to postulate that the microorganisms he was seeing were involved in human diseases, including cancer (Citation3-6). He invented a machine that he claimed could transmit radio frequency energy into a person and vibrate these microorganisms at a mortal oscillatory rate, thereby killing them and improving the disease they were causing (Citation3-6). Rife's claims were based upon his microscopic evaluations, which again do not appear to be legitimate. The very concept that diseases can be cured by radio frequency energy, originally proposed by Albert Abrams and referred to as 'radionics' (Citation7), was later investigated and disproven by the Scientific American (Citation7,Citation8). Nonetheless, there remain those who believe in Rife's work, claim it was suppressed as part of an elaborate conspiracy (Citation9) and continue to sell similar energy-transmitting devices (Citation10-12). Here, on behalf of PALS who asked about it, we review the potential use of the Rife Machine for ALS.
Question: Does the abstract of the scientific paper support the claim?

Answer: Step 1: Read the whole abstract and extract information relevant to the question. The abstract describes the development of special microscopes by Royal Raymond Rife in the 1920s and 1930s. Rife claimed that these microscopes could visualize living microorganisms, including viruses, and that the colors emitted by these microorganisms allowed for their identification. Rife proposed that the microorganisms he observed were involved in human diseases, such as cancer, and invented a machine that he claimed could transmit radio frequency energy to kill these microorganisms and improve the associated diseases. However, Rife's claims and the concept of curing diseases with radio frequency energy have not been validated and were later disproven. Despite this, there are still people who believe in Rife's work and sell similar energy-transmitting devices.
Step 2: Identify the relevant statement: “The very concept that diseases can be cured by radio frequency energy, originally proposed by Albert Abrams and referred to as 'radionics' (Citation7), was later investigated and disproven by the Scientific American (Citation7,Citation8).”
Step 3: Give reasoning to rationalize your decision: Radionics has previously been investigated and disproved in research conducted by Scientific American and thereby cannot cure cancer. 
Step 4: Conclusion: The abstract refutes the claim in the news. The rationale is this sentence: “The very concept that diseases… disproven by the Scientific American (Citation7,Citation8).”

Claim: U.S. carrots are 'soaked' in bleach, chlorpropham is used.
Abstract: World over, potatoes are being stored at 8-12 ¬∞C (85-90 % RH). This is the most common way of long-term (up to 6 to 9 months) storage of potatoes. The benefit of storing the potatoes within the temperature range of 8-12 ¬∞C is minimum accumulation of sugars in stored potato tubers. In sub-temperate, sub-tropical and tropical countries of the world, short-term (3 to 4 months) storage of potatoes is being done by non-refrigerated traditional/on-farm methods. These short- and long-term storage methods keep the stored potatoes suitable not only for table purpose but also for processing. However, once the natural dormancy period of potato is over, the prevailing temperatures in these storage methods favour sprouting and sprout growth. Therefore, use of some sprout suppressant to check the sprout growth becomes essential under these methods of potato storage. CIPC [Isopropyl N-(3-chlorophenyl) carbamate] is the most wide spread and commonly used sprout suppressant on potatoes. CIPC has been in use for more than 50 years and research carried out over such a long period use of CIPC has not only enhanced our understanding of its properties and chemistry but also about the production and toxicological status of its metabolites/degradation products. Today, various safety issues and concerns have surfaced primarily due to continuous and long-term use of CIPC. This review presents an appraisal on CIPC and explains the reasons for the long-time dependence on this chemical as a potato sprout suppressant. Issues like maximum residue limit and acceptable daily intake limit are being discussed for CIPC. This article brings an update on practical aspects of potato storage, residue levels of CIPC, efficacy of CIPC as sprout suppressant and health and environmental safety issues linked with CIPC and its metabolites. The aim of this article is to find possible solutions, way outs and future plans that can make the sprout suppression of potatoes safer and more risk free.

Claim: Cancer is caused by a deficiency of vitamin B17.
Abstract: One hundred seventy-eight patients with cancer were treated with amygdalin (Laetrile) plus a ""metabolic therapy"" program consisting of diet, enzymes, and vitamins. The great majority of these patients were in good general condition before treatment. None was totally disabled or in preterminal condition. One third had not received any previous chemotherapy. The pharmaceutical preparations of amygdalin, the dosage, and the schedule were representative of past and present Laetrile practice. No substantive benefit was observed in terms of cure, improvement or stabilization of cancer, improvement of symptoms related to cancer, or extension of life span. The hazards of amygdalin therapy were evidenced in several patients by symptoms of cyanide toxicity or by blood cyanide levels approaching the lethal range. Patients exposed to this agent should be instructed about the danger of cyanide poisoning, and their blood cyanide levels should be carefully monitored. Amygdalin (Laetrile) is a toxic drug that is not effective as a cancer treatment.

Claim: Updated CDC guidance on monkeypox transmission still includes 'respiratory transmission'.
Abstract: Planning a response to an outbreak of a pandemic strain of influenza is a high public health priority. Three research groups using different individual-based, stochastic simulation models have examined the consequences of intervention strategies chosen in consultation with U.S. public health workers. The first goal is to simulate the effectiveness of a set of potentially feasible intervention strategies. Combinations called targeted layered containment (TLC) of influenza antiviral treatment and prophylaxis and nonpharmaceutical interventions of quarantine, isolation, school closure, community social distancing, and workplace social distancing are considered. The second goal is to examine the robustness of the results to model assumptions. The comparisons focus on a pandemic outbreak in a population similar to that of Chicago, with ?8.6 million people. The simulations suggest that at the expected transmissibility of a pandemic strain, timely implementation of a combination of targeted household antiviral prophylaxis, and social distancing measures could substantially lower the illness attack rate before a highly efficacious vaccine could become available. Timely initiation of measures and school closure play important roles. Because of the current lack of data on which to base such models, further field research is recommended to learn more about the sources of transmission and the effectiveness of social distancing measures in reducing influenza transmission.

Claim: Sun exposure, and diet, causes skin cancers.
Abstract: Melanoma and keratinocyte skin cancer (KSC) are the most common types of cancer in White-skinned populations. Both tumor entities showed increasing incidence rates worldwide but stable or decreasing mortality rates. Rising incidence rates of cutaneous melanoma (CM) and KSC are largely attributed to increasing exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, the main causal risk factor for skin cancer. Incidence rates of KSC, comprising of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), are much higher than that of melanoma. BCC development is mainly the cause of an intensive UV exposure in childhood and adolescence, while SCC development is related to chronic, cumulative UV exposure over decades. Although mortality is relatively low, KSC is an increasing problem for health care services causing significant morbidity. Cutaneous melanoma is rapidly increasing in White populations, with an estimated annual increase of around 3-7% over the past decades. In contrast to SCC, melanoma risk is associated with intermittent and chronic exposure to sunlight. The frequency of its occurrence is closely associated with the constitutive color of the skin and the geographical zone. Changes in outdoor activities and exposure to sunlight during the past 70 years are an important factor for the increasing incidence of melanoma. Mortality rates of melanoma show stabilization in the USA, Australia, and in European countries. In the USA even dropping numbers of death cases were recently reported, probably reflecting efficacy of the new systemic treatments. Among younger cohorts in some populations (e.g., Australia and New Zealand,), stabilizing or declining incidence rates of CM are observed, potentially caused by primary prevention campaigns aimed at reducing UV exposure. In contrast, incidence rates of CM are still rising in most European countries and in the USA. Ongoing trends towards thinner melanoma are largely ascribed to earlier detection.

Claim: Peanut butter can be used to diagnose Alzheimer's Disease.
Abstract: Olfactory dysfunction is associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD), and already present at pre-dementia stage. Based on the assumption that early neurodegeneration in AD is asymmetrical and that olfactory input is primarily processed in the ipsilateral hemisphere, we assessed whether unirhinal psychophysical and electrophysiological assessment of olfactory function can contribute to the diagnostic workup of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Olfactory function of 13 MCI patients with positive amyloid PET, 13 aged-matched controls (AC) with negative amyloid PET and 13 patients with post-infectious olfactory loss (OD) was assessed unirhinally using (1) psychophysical testing of olfactory detection, discrimination and identification performance and (2) the recording of olfactory event-related brain potentials. Time-frequency analysis was used to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of the electrophysiological responses. Psychophysical and electrophysiological assessment of auditory and trigeminal chemosensory function served as controls. As compared to AC and OD, MCI patients exhibited a significant asymmetry of olfactory performance. This asymmetry efficiently discriminated between MCI and AC (sensitivity: 85% , specificity: 77% ), as well as MCI and OD (sensitivity: 85% , specificity: 70% ). There was also an asymmetry of the electrophysiological responses, but not specific for MCI. In both MCI and OD, olfactory stimulation of the best nostril elicited significantly more activity than stimulation of the worse nostril, between 3-7.5 Hz and 1.2-2.0 s after stimulus onset. Trigeminal and auditory psychophysical testing did not show any difference between groups. MCI patients exhibit a marked asymmetry of behavioral olfactory function, which could be useful for the diagnostic workup of MCI.

Claim: U.S. carrots are 'soaked' in bleach, chlorpropham is used.
Abstract: World over, potatoes are being stored at 8-12 ¬∞C (85-90 % RH). This is the most common way of long-term (up to 6 to 9 months) storage of potatoes. The benefit of storing the potatoes within the temperature range of 8-12 ¬∞C is minimum accumulation of sugars in stored potato tubers. In sub-temperate, sub-tropical and tropical countries of the world, short-term (3 to 4 months) storage of potatoes is being done by non-refrigerated traditional/on-farm methods. These short- and long-term storage methods keep the stored potatoes suitable not only for table purpose but also for processing. However, once the natural dormancy period of potato is over, the prevailing temperatures in these storage methods favour sprouting and sprout growth. Therefore, use of some sprout suppressant to check the sprout growth becomes essential under these methods of potato storage. CIPC [Isopropyl N-(3-chlorophenyl) carbamate] is the most wide spread and commonly used sprout suppressant on potatoes. CIPC has been in use for more than 50 years and research carried out over such a long period use of CIPC has not only enhanced our understanding of its properties and chemistry but also about the production and toxicological status of its metabolites/degradation products. Today, various safety issues and concerns have surfaced primarily due to continuous and long-term use of CIPC. This review presents an appraisal on CIPC and explains the reasons for the long-time dependence on this chemical as a potato sprout suppressant. Issues like maximum residue limit and acceptable daily intake limit are being discussed for CIPC. This article brings an update on practical aspects of potato storage, residue levels of CIPC, efficacy of CIPC as sprout suppressant and health and environmental safety issues linked with CIPC and its metabolites. The aim of this article is to find possible solutions, way outs and future plans that can make the sprout suppression of potatoes safer and more risk free.

Claim: During pregnancy, if the mother suffers organ damage, the baby in the womb sends stem cells to repair the damaged organ.
Abstract: T lymphocytes of fetal origin found in maternal circulation after gestation have been reported as a possible cause for autoimmune diseases. During gestation, mothers acquire CD34+CD38+ cells of fetal origin that persist decades. In this study, we asked whether fetal T and B cells could develop from these progenitors in the maternal thymus and bone marrow during and after gestation. RAG-/--deficient female mice (Ly5.2) were mated to congenic wild-type Ly5.1 mice (RAG+/+). Fetal double-positive T cells (CD4+CD8+) with characteristic TCR and IL-7R expression patterns could be recovered in maternal thymus during the resulting pregnancies. We made similar observations in the thymus of immunocompetent mothers. Such phenomenon was observed overall in 12 of 68 tested mice compared with 0 of 51 controls (p=0.001). T cells could also be found in maternal spleen and produced IFN-gamma in the presence of an allogenic or an Ag-specific stimulus. Similarly, CD19+IgM+ fetal B cells as well as plasma Igs could be found in maternal RAG-/- bone marrow and spleen after similar matings. Our results suggest that during gestation mothers acquire fetal lymphoid progenitors that develop into functional T cells. This fetal cell microchimerism may have a direct impact on maternal health.

Claim: Updated CDC guidance on monkeypox transmission still includes 'respiratory transmission'.
Abstract: Planning a response to an outbreak of a pandemic strain of influenza is a high public health priority. Three research groups using different individual-based, stochastic simulation models have examined the consequences of intervention strategies chosen in consultation with U.S. public health workers. The first goal is to simulate the effectiveness of a set of potentially feasible intervention strategies. Combinations called targeted layered containment (TLC) of influenza antiviral treatment and prophylaxis and nonpharmaceutical interventions of quarantine, isolation, school closure, community social distancing, and workplace social distancing are considered. The second goal is to examine the robustness of the results to model assumptions. The comparisons focus on a pandemic outbreak in a population similar to that of Chicago, with ?8.6 million people. The simulations suggest that at the expected transmissibility of a pandemic strain, timely implementation of a combination of targeted household antiviral prophylaxis, and social distancing measures could substantially lower the illness attack rate before a highly efficacious vaccine could become available. Timely initiation of measures and school closure play important roles. Because of the current lack of data on which to base such models, further field research is recommended to learn more about the sources of transmission and the effectiveness of social distancing measures in reducing influenza transmission.

Claim: Sun exposure, and diet, causes skin cancers.
Abstract: Melanoma and keratinocyte skin cancer (KSC) are the most common types of cancer in White-skinned populations. Both tumor entities showed increasing incidence rates worldwide but stable or decreasing mortality rates. Rising incidence rates of cutaneous melanoma (CM) and KSC are largely attributed to increasing exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, the main causal risk factor for skin cancer. Incidence rates of KSC, comprising of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), are much higher than that of melanoma. BCC development is mainly the cause of an intensive UV exposure in childhood and adolescence, while SCC development is related to chronic, cumulative UV exposure over decades. Although mortality is relatively low, KSC is an increasing problem for health care services causing significant morbidity. Cutaneous melanoma is rapidly increasing in White populations, with an estimated annual increase of around 3-7% over the past decades. In contrast to SCC, melanoma risk is associated with intermittent and chronic exposure to sunlight. The frequency of its occurrence is closely associated with the constitutive color of the skin and the geographical zone. Changes in outdoor activities and exposure to sunlight during the past 70 years are an important factor for the increasing incidence of melanoma. Mortality rates of melanoma show stabilization in the USA, Australia, and in European countries. In the USA even dropping numbers of death cases were recently reported, probably reflecting efficacy of the new systemic treatments. Among younger cohorts in some populations (e.g., Australia and New Zealand,), stabilizing or declining incidence rates of CM are observed, potentially caused by primary prevention campaigns aimed at reducing UV exposure. In contrast, incidence rates of CM are still rising in most European countries and in the USA. Ongoing trends towards thinner melanoma are largely ascribed to earlier detection.

The rationale in this sentence is: “Among younger cohorts in some populations (e.g., Australia and New Zealand), stabilizing or declining incidence rates of CM [cutaneous melanoma] are observed, potentially caused by primary prevention campaigns aimed at reducing UV exposure.""

Claim: Targeting cancer cells with resonant frequencies has been shown to 'cure' cancer.
Abstract: In the 1920s and 1930s, Royal Raymond Rife developed special microscopes. Using these he claimed he could visualize living microorganisms, including viruses too small to be seen with any other existing technology, via the color of auras emitted as they vibrated (Citation1). In a 1961 deposition he explained this as follows: A special risley prism which works on a counter rotation principle selects a portion of the light frequency which illuminates these viruses in their own characteristic chemical colors by emission of coordinative light frequency and the viruses become readily identifiable by the colors revealed on observation. (Citation2). Several of his microscopes still exist. Their principles and alleged function have never been validated, and they have never been adopted for use. Rife went on to postulate that the microorganisms he was seeing were involved in human diseases, including cancer (Citation3-6). He invented a machine that he claimed could transmit radio frequency energy into a person and vibrate these microorganisms at a mortal oscillatory rate, thereby killing them and improving the disease they were causing (Citation3-6). Rife's claims were based upon his microscopic evaluations, which again do not appear to be legitimate. The very concept that diseases can be cured by radio frequency energy, originally proposed by Albert Abrams and referred to as 'radionics' (Citation7), was later investigated and disproven by the Scientific American (Citation7,Citation8). Nonetheless, there remain those who believe in Rife's work, claim it was suppressed as part of an elaborate conspiracy (Citation9) and continue to sell similar energy-transmitting devices (Citation10-12). Here, on behalf of PALS who asked about it, we review the potential use of the Rife Machine for ALS.

Claim: Marijuana plays a role in healing broken bones.
Abstract: Cannabis sativa is the source of a unique set of compounds known collectively as plant cannabinoids or phytocannabinoids. This review focuses on the manner with which three of these compounds, (?)-trans-?9-tetrahydrocannabinol (?9-THC), (?)-cannabidiol (CBD) and (?)-trans-?9-tetrahydrocannabivarin (?9-THCV), interact with cannabinoid CB1 and CB2 receptors. ?9-THC, the main psychotropic constituent of cannabis, is a CB1 and CB2 receptor partial agonist and in line with classical pharmacology, the responses it elicits appear to be strongly influenced both by the expression level and signalling efficiency of cannabinoid receptors and by ongoing endogenous cannabinoid release. CBD displays unexpectedly high potency as an antagonist of CB1/CB2 receptor agonists in CB1- and CB2-expressing cells or tissues, the manner with which it interacts with CB2 receptors providing a possible explanation for its ability to inhibit evoked immune cell migration. ?9-THCV behaves as a potent CB2 receptor partial agonist in vitro. In contrast, it antagonizes cannabinoid receptor agonists in CB1-expressing tissues. This it does with relatively high potency and in a manner that is both tissue and ligand dependent. ?9-THCV also interacts with CB1 receptors when administered in vivo, behaving either as a CB1 antagonist or, at higher doses, as a CB1 receptor agonist. Brief mention is also made in this review, first of the production by ?9-THC of pharmacodynamic tolerance, second of current knowledge about the extent to which ?9-THC, CBD and ?9-THCV interact with pharmacological targets other than CB1 or CB2 receptors, and third of actual and potential therapeutic applications for each of these cannabinoids.

Claim: Updated CDC guidance on monkeypox transmission still includes 'respiratory transmission'.
Abstract: Planning a response to an outbreak of a pandemic strain of influenza is a high public health priority. Three research groups using different individual-based, stochastic simulation models have examined the consequences of intervention strategies chosen in consultation with U.S. public health workers. The first goal is to simulate the effectiveness of a set of potentially feasible intervention strategies. Combinations called targeted layered containment (TLC) of influenza antiviral treatment and prophylaxis and nonpharmaceutical interventions of quarantine, isolation, school closure, community social distancing, and workplace social distancing are considered. The second goal is to examine the robustness of the results to model assumptions. The comparisons focus on a pandemic outbreak in a population similar to that of Chicago, with ?8.6 million people. The simulations suggest that at the expected transmissibility of a pandemic strain, timely implementation of a combination of targeted household antiviral prophylaxis, and social distancing measures could substantially lower the illness attack rate before a highly efficacious vaccine could become available. Timely initiation of measures and school closure play important roles. Because of the current lack of data on which to base such models, further field research is recommended to learn more about the sources of transmission and the effectiveness of social distancing measures in reducing influenza transmission.

Claim: Sun exposure, and diet, causes skin cancers.
Abstract: Melanoma and keratinocyte skin cancer (KSC) are the most common types of cancer in White-skinned populations. Both tumor entities showed increasing incidence rates worldwide but stable or decreasing mortality rates. Rising incidence rates of cutaneous melanoma (CM) and KSC are largely attributed to increasing exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, the main causal risk factor for skin cancer. Incidence rates of KSC, comprising of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), are much higher than that of melanoma. BCC development is mainly the cause of an intensive UV exposure in childhood and adolescence, while SCC development is related to chronic, cumulative UV exposure over decades. Although mortality is relatively low, KSC is an increasing problem for health care services causing significant morbidity. Cutaneous melanoma is rapidly increasing in White populations, with an estimated annual increase of around 3-7% over the past decades. In contrast to SCC, melanoma risk is associated with intermittent and chronic exposure to sunlight. The frequency of its occurrence is closely associated with the constitutive color of the skin and the geographical zone. Changes in outdoor activities and exposure to sunlight during the past 70 years are an important factor for the increasing incidence of melanoma. Mortality rates of melanoma show stabilization in the USA, Australia, and in European countries. In the USA even dropping numbers of death cases were recently reported, probably reflecting efficacy of the new systemic treatments. Among younger cohorts in some populations (e.g., Australia and New Zealand,), stabilizing or declining incidence rates of CM are observed, potentially caused by primary prevention campaigns aimed at reducing UV exposure. In contrast, incidence rates of CM are still rising in most European countries and in the USA. Ongoing trends towards thinner melanoma are largely ascribed to earlier detection.

The rationale in this sentence is: “Among younger cohorts in some populations (e.g., Australia and New Zealand), stabilizing or declining incidence rates of CM [cutaneous melanoma] are observed, potentially caused by primary prevention campaigns aimed at reducing UV exposure.""

Claim: Targeting cancer cells with resonant frequencies has been shown to 'cure' cancer.
Abstract: In the 1920s and 1930s, Royal Raymond Rife developed special microscopes. Using these he claimed he could visualize living microorganisms, including viruses too small to be seen with any other existing technology, via the color of auras emitted as they vibrated (Citation1). In a 1961 deposition he explained this as follows: A special risley prism which works on a counter rotation principle selects a portion of the light frequency which illuminates these viruses in their own characteristic chemical colors by emission of coordinative light frequency and the viruses become readily identifiable by the colors revealed on observation. (Citation2). Several of his microscopes still exist. Their principles and alleged function have never been validated, and they have never been adopted for use. Rife went on to postulate that the microorganisms he was seeing were involved in human diseases, including cancer (Citation3-6). He invented a machine that he claimed could transmit radio frequency energy into a person and vibrate these microorganisms at a mortal oscillatory rate, thereby killing them and improving the disease they were causing (Citation3-6). Rife's claims were based upon his microscopic evaluations, which again do not appear to be legitimate. The very concept that diseases can be cured by radio frequency energy, originally proposed by Albert Abrams and referred to as 'radionics' (Citation7), was later investigated and disproven by the Scientific American (Citation7,Citation8). Nonetheless, there remain those who believe in Rife's work, claim it was suppressed as part of an elaborate conspiracy (Citation9) and continue to sell similar energy-transmitting devices (Citation10-12). Here, on behalf of PALS who asked about it, we review the potential use of the Rife Machine for ALS.

Claim: U.S. carrots are 'soaked' in bleach, chlorpropham is used.
Abstract: World over, potatoes are being stored at 8-12 ¬∞C (85-90 % RH). This is the most common way of long-term (up to 6 to 9 months) storage of potatoes. The benefit of storing the potatoes within the temperature range of 8-12 ¬∞C is minimum accumulation of sugars in stored potato tubers. In sub-temperate, sub-tropical and tropical countries of the world, short-term (3 to 4 months) storage of potatoes is being done by non-refrigerated traditional/on-farm methods. These short- and long-term storage methods keep the stored potatoes suitable not only for table purpose but also for processing. However, once the natural dormancy period of potato is over, the prevailing temperatures in these storage methods favour sprouting and sprout growth. Therefore, use of some sprout suppressant to check the sprout growth becomes essential under these methods of potato storage. CIPC [Isopropyl N-(3-chlorophenyl) carbamate] is the most wide spread and commonly used sprout suppressant on potatoes. CIPC has been in use for more than 50 years and research carried out over such a long period use of CIPC has not only enhanced our understanding of its properties and chemistry but also about the production and toxicological status of its metabolites/degradation products. Today, various safety issues and concerns have surfaced primarily due to continuous and long-term use of CIPC. This review presents an appraisal on CIPC and explains the reasons for the long-time dependence on this chemical as a potato sprout suppressant. Issues like maximum residue limit and acceptable daily intake limit are being discussed for CIPC. This article brings an update on practical aspects of potato storage, residue levels of CIPC, efficacy of CIPC as sprout suppressant and health and environmental safety issues linked with CIPC and its metabolites. The aim of this article is to find possible solutions, way outs and future plans that can make the sprout suppression of potatoes safer and more risk free.

Claim: A recent invasion of New Guinea Flatworms in Florida poses a significant risk to human health.
Abstract: The life cycle of the nematode Angiostrongylus cantonensis involves rats as the definitive host and slugs and snails as intermediate hosts. Humans can become infected upon ingestion of intermediate or paratenic (passive carrier) hosts containing stage L3 A. cantonensis larvae. Here, we report a quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay that provides a reliable, relative measure of parasite load in intermediate hosts. Quantification of the levels of infection of intermediate hosts is critical for determining A. cantonensis intensity on the Island of Hawaii. The identification of high intensity infection 'hotspots' will allow for more effective targeted rat and slug control measures. qPCR appears more efficient and sensitive than microscopy and provides a new tool for quantification of larvae from intermediate hosts, and potentially from other sources as well.

Claim: If the vial to a mercury-containing vaccine is broken, the building must be evacuated.
Abstract: Tunas are apex predators in marine food webs that can accumulate mercury (Hg) to high concentrations and provide more Hg (?40%) to the U.S population than any other source. We measured Hg concentrations in 1292 Atlantic bluefin tuna (ABFT, Thunnus thynnus) captured in the Northwest Atlantic from 2004 to 2012. ABFT Hg concentrations and variability increased nonlinearly with length, weight, and age, ranging from 0.25 to 3.15 mg kg-1, and declined significantly at a rate of 0.018 ¬± 0.003 mg kg-1 per year or 19% over an 8-year period from the 1990s to the early 2000s. Notably, this decrease parallels comparably reduced anthropogenic Hg emission rates in North America and North Atlantic atmospheric Hg0 concentrations during this period, suggesting that recent efforts to decrease atmospheric Hg loading have rapidly propagated up marine food webs to a commercially important species. This is the first evidence to suggest that emission reduction efforts have resulted in lower Hg concentrations in large, long-lived fish.
Question: Does the abstract of the scientific paper support the claim?

","Answer: Step 1: Read the whole abstract and extract information relevant to the question. The abstract discusses the accumulation of mercury in Atlantic bluefin tuna, a species that provides a significant amount of mercury to the U.S. population. It presents data on mercury concentrations in these fish and notes a significant decline in these concentrations over an 8-year period, which parallels reduced anthropogenic mercury emission rates in North America and North Atlantic atmospheric mercury concentrations. This suggests that efforts to decrease atmospheric mercury loading have had a rapid impact on marine food webs.

Claim: Sun exposure, and diet, causes skin cancers.
Abstract: Melanoma and keratinocyte skin cancer (KSC) are the most common types of cancer in White-skinned populations. Both tumor entities showed increasing incidence rates worldwide but stable or decreasing mortality rates. Rising incidence rates of cutaneous melanoma (CM) and KSC are largely attributed to increasing exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, the main causal risk factor for skin cancer. Incidence rates of KSC, comprising of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), are much higher than that of melanoma. BCC development is mainly the cause of an intensive UV exposure in childhood and adolescence, while SCC development is related to chronic, cumulative UV exposure over decades. Although mortality is relatively low, KSC is an increasing problem for health care services causing significant morbidity. Cutaneous melanoma is rapidly increasing in White populations, with an estimated annual increase of around 3-7% over the past decades. In contrast to SCC, melanoma risk is associated with intermittent and chronic exposure to sunlight. The frequency of its occurrence is closely associated with the constitutive color of the skin and the geographical zone. Changes in outdoor activities and exposure to sunlight during the past 70 years are an important factor for the increasing incidence of melanoma. Mortality rates of melanoma show stabilization in the USA, Australia, and in European countries. In the USA even dropping numbers of death cases were recently reported, probably reflecting efficacy of the new systemic treatments. Among younger cohorts in some populations (e.g., Australia and New Zealand,), stabilizing or declining incidence rates of CM are observed, potentially caused by primary prevention campaigns aimed at reducing UV exposure. In contrast, incidence rates of CM are still rising in most European countries and in the USA. Ongoing trends towards thinner melanoma are largely ascribed to earlier detection.
Question: Does the abstract of the scientific paper support the claim?

Answer: Step 1: Read the whole abstract and extract information relevant to the question. The abstract highlights that melanoma and keratinocyte skin cancer (KSC) are the most common types of cancer in White-skinned populations, with increasing incidence rates worldwide but stable or decreasing mortality rates. The rising incidence rates are largely attributed to increasing exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Incidence rates of KSC, comprising basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), are much higher than that of melanoma. Additionally, it discusses the factors contributing to the development of BCC and SCC, as well as the risk factors associated with melanoma. Furthermore, it mentions the trends in mortality rates of melanoma, primary prevention campaigns aimed at reducing UV exposure, and ongoing trends towards thinner melanoma largely ascribed to earlier detection.
Step 2: Identify the relevant statement: “Among younger cohorts in some populations (e.g., Australia and New Zealand), stabilizing or declining incidence rates of CM [cutaneous melanoma] are observed, potentially caused by primary prevention campaigns aimed at reducing UV exposure.""
Step 3: Give reasoning to rationalize your decision: The stabilization or decline in CM rates in younger cohorts is attributed to successful primary prevention campaigns that aim to reduce UV exposure, indicating that targeted public health measures can effectively mitigate the rising trend of melanoma in specific demographics. 
Step 4: Conclusion: The abstract refutes the claim in the scientific news. The rationale in this sentence is: “Among younger cohorts in some populations (e.g., Australia and New Zealand), stabilizing or declining incidence rates of CM [cutaneous melanoma] are observed, potentially caused by primary prevention campaigns aimed at reducing UV exposure.""

Claim: Targeting cancer cells with resonant frequencies has been shown to 'cure' cancer.
Abstract: In the 1920s and 1930s, Royal Raymond Rife developed special microscopes. Using these he claimed he could visualize living microorganisms, including viruses too small to be seen with any other existing technology, via the color of auras emitted as they vibrated (Citation1). In a 1961 deposition he explained this as follows: A special risley prism which works on a counter rotation principle selects a portion of the light frequency which illuminates these viruses in their own characteristic chemical colors by emission of coordinative light frequency and the viruses become readily identifiable by the colors revealed on observation. (Citation2). Several of his microscopes still exist. Their principles and alleged function have never been validated, and they have never been adopted for use. Rife went on to postulate that the microorganisms he was seeing were involved in human diseases, including cancer (Citation3-6). He invented a machine that he claimed could transmit radio frequency energy into a person and vibrate these microorganisms at a mortal oscillatory rate, thereby killing them and improving the disease they were causing (Citation3-6). Rife's claims were based upon his microscopic evaluations, which again do not appear to be legitimate. The very concept that diseases can be cured by radio frequency energy, originally proposed by Albert Abrams and referred to as 'radionics' (Citation7), was later investigated and disproven by the Scientific American (Citation7,Citation8). Nonetheless, there remain those who believe in Rife's work, claim it was suppressed as part of an elaborate conspiracy (Citation9) and continue to sell similar energy-transmitting devices (Citation10-12). Here, on behalf of PALS who asked about it, we review the potential use of the Rife Machine for ALS.

Claim: U.S. carrots are 'soaked' in bleach, chlorpropham is used.
Abstract: World over, potatoes are being stored at 8-12 ¬∞C (85-90 % RH). This is the most common way of long-term (up to 6 to 9 months) storage of potatoes. The benefit of storing the potatoes within the temperature range of 8-12 ¬∞C is minimum accumulation of sugars in stored potato tubers. In sub-temperate, sub-tropical and tropical countries of the world, short-term (3 to 4 months) storage of potatoes is being done by non-refrigerated traditional/on-farm methods. These short- and long-term storage methods keep the stored potatoes suitable not only for table purpose but also for processing. However, once the natural dormancy period of potato is over, the prevailing temperatures in these storage methods favour sprouting and sprout growth. Therefore, use of some sprout suppressant to check the sprout growth becomes essential under these methods of potato storage. CIPC [Isopropyl N-(3-chlorophenyl) carbamate] is the most wide spread and commonly used sprout suppressant on potatoes. CIPC has been in use for more than 50 years and research carried out over such a long period use of CIPC has not only enhanced our understanding of its properties and chemistry but also about the production and toxicological status of its metabolites/degradation products. Today, various safety issues and concerns have surfaced primarily due to continuous and long-term use of CIPC. This review presents an appraisal on CIPC and explains the reasons for the long-time dependence on this chemical as a potato sprout suppressant. Issues like maximum residue limit and acceptable daily intake limit are being discussed for CIPC. This article brings an update on practical aspects of potato storage, residue levels of CIPC, efficacy of CIPC as sprout suppressant and health and environmental safety issues linked with CIPC and its metabolites. The aim of this article is to find possible solutions, way outs and future plans that can make the sprout suppression of potatoes safer and more risk free.

Claim: Abortions increase a woman's risk of developing breast cancer.
Abstract: STUDY OBJECTIVE: To ascertain, from the published reports to date, whether or not a significantly increased risk of breast cancer is specifically attributable to a history of induced abortion, independent of spontaneous abortion and age at first full term pregnancy (or first live birth); to establish the relative magnitude of such risk increase as may be found, and to ascertain and quantify such risk increases as may pertain to particular subpopulations of women exposed to induced abortion; in particular, nulliparous women and parous women exposed before compared with after the first full term pregnancy. INCLUDED STUDIES: The meta-analysis includes all 28 published reports which include specific data on induced abortion and breast cancer incidence. Since some study data are presented in more than one report, the 28 reports were determined to constitute 23 independent studies. Overall induced abortion odds ratios and odds ratios for the different subpopulations were calculated using an average weighted according to the inverse of the variance. An overall unweighted average was also computed for comparison. No quality criteria were imposed, but a narrative review of all included studies is presented for the reader's use in assessing the quality of individual studies. EXCLUDED STUDIES: All 33 published reports including data on abortion and breast cancer incidence but either pertaining only to spontaneous abortion or to abortion without specification as to whether it was induced or spontaneous. These studies are listed for the reader's information. RESULTS: The overall odds ratio (for any induced abortion exposure; n = 21 studies) was 1.3 (95% confidence interval of 1.2, 1.4). For comparison, the unweighted overall odds ratio was 1.4 (1.3,1.6). The odds ratio for nulliparous women was 1.3 (1.0,1.6), that for abortion before the first term pregnancy in parous women was 1.5 (1.2,1.8), and that for abortion after the first term pregnancy was 1.3 (1.1,1.5). CONCLUSIONS: The results support the inclusion of induced abortion among significant independent risk factors for breast cancer, regardless of parity or timing of abortion relative to the first term pregnancy. Although the increase in risk was relatively low, the high incidence of both breast cancer and induced abortion suggest a substantial impact of thousands of excess cases per year currently, and a potentially much greater impact in the next century, as the first cohort of women exposed to legal induced abortion continues to age.

Claim: Updated CDC guidance on monkeypox transmission still includes 'respiratory transmission'.
Abstract: Planning a response to an outbreak of a pandemic strain of influenza is a high public health priority. Three research groups using different individual-based, stochastic simulation models have examined the consequences of intervention strategies chosen in consultation with U.S. public health workers. The first goal is to simulate the effectiveness of a set of potentially feasible intervention strategies. Combinations called targeted layered containment (TLC) of influenza antiviral treatment and prophylaxis and nonpharmaceutical interventions of quarantine, isolation, school closure, community social distancing, and workplace social distancing are considered. The second goal is to examine the robustness of the results to model assumptions. The comparisons focus on a pandemic outbreak in a population similar to that of Chicago, with ?8.6 million people. The simulations suggest that at the expected transmissibility of a pandemic strain, timely implementation of a combination of targeted household antiviral prophylaxis, and social distancing measures could substantially lower the illness attack rate before a highly efficacious vaccine could become available. Timely initiation of measures and school closure play important roles. Because of the current lack of data on which to base such models, further field research is recommended to learn more about the sources of transmission and the effectiveness of social distancing measures in reducing influenza transmission.

Claim: Salt lamps emit negatively charged ions, providing a myriad health benefits including reduced anxiety, improved sleep, increased energy, and protection from an electric smog.
Abstract: The neural mechanism by which negative air ions (NAI) mediate the regulation of autonomic nervous system activity is still unknown. We examined the effects of NAI on physiological responses, such as blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), and heart rate variability (HRV) as well as neuronal activity, in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN), locus coeruleus (LC), nucleus ambiguus (NA), and nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) with c-Fos immunohistochemistry in anesthetized, spontaneously breathing rats. In addition, we performed cervical vagotomy to reveal the afferent pathway involved in mediating the effects of NAI on autonomic regulation. NAI significantly decreased BP and HR, and increased HF power of the HRV spectrum. Significant decreases in c-Fos positive nuclei in the PVN and LC, and enhancement of c-Fos expression in the NA and NTS were induced by NAI. After vagotomy, these physiological and neuronal responses to NAI were not observed. These findings suggest that NAI can modulate autonomic regulation through inhibition of neuronal activity in PVN and LC as well as activation of NA neurons, and that these effects of NAI might be mediated via the vagus nerves.

Claim: Sun exposure, and diet, causes skin cancers.
Abstract: Melanoma and keratinocyte skin cancer (KSC) are the most common types of cancer in White-skinned populations. Both tumor entities showed increasing incidence rates worldwide but stable or decreasing mortality rates. Rising incidence rates of cutaneous melanoma (CM) and KSC are largely attributed to increasing exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, the main causal risk factor for skin cancer. Incidence rates of KSC, comprising of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), are much higher than that of melanoma.

The frequency of its occurrence is closely associated with the constitutive color of the skin and the geographical zone. Changes in outdoor activities and exposure to sunlight during the past 70 years are an important factor for the increasing incidence of melanoma. Mortality rates of melanoma show stabilization in the USA, Australia, and in European countries.

Claim: Targeting cancer cells with resonant frequencies has been shown to 'cure' cancer.
Abstract: In the 1920s and 1930s, Royal Raymond Rife developed special microscopes. Using these he claimed he could visualize living microorganisms, including viruses too small to be seen with any other existing technology, via the color of auras emitted as they vibrated (Citation1). In a 1961 deposition he explained this as follows: A special risley prism which works on a counter rotation principle selects a portion of the light frequency which illuminates these viruses in their own characteristic chemical colors by emission of coordinative light frequency and the viruses become readily identifiable by the colors revealed on observation. (Citation2). Several of his microscopes still exist. Their principles and alleged function have never been validated, and they have never been adopted for use. Rife went on to postulate that the microorganisms he was seeing were involved in human diseases, including cancer (Citation3-6). He invented a machine that he claimed could transmit radio frequency energy into a person and vibrate these microorganisms at a mortal oscillatory rate, thereby killing them and improving the disease they were causing (Citation3-6). Rife's claims were based upon his microscopic evaluations, which again do not appear to be legitimate. The very concept that diseases can be cured by radio frequency energy, originally proposed by Albert Abrams and referred to as 'radionics' (Citation7), was later investigated and disproven by the Scientific American (Citation7,Citation8). Nonetheless, there remain those who believe in Rife's work, claim it was suppressed as part of an elaborate conspiracy (Citation9) and continue to sell similar energy-transmitting devices (Citation10-12). Here, on behalf of PALS who asked about it, we review the potential use of the Rife Machine for ALS.

Claim: U.S. carrots are 'soaked' in bleach, chlorpropham is used.
Abstract: World over, potatoes are being stored at 8-12 ¬∞C (85-90 % RH). This is the most common way of long-term (up to 6 to 9 months) storage of potatoes. The benefit of storing the potatoes within the temperature range of 8-12 ¬∞C is minimum accumulation of sugars in stored potato tubers. In sub-temperate, sub-tropical and tropical countries of the world, short-term (3 to 4 months) storage of potatoes is being done by non-refrigerated traditional/on-farm methods. These short- and long-term storage methods keep the stored potatoes suitable not only for table purpose but also for processing. However, once the natural dormancy period of potato is over, the prevailing temperatures in these storage methods favour sprouting and sprout growth. Therefore, use of some sprout suppressant to check the sprout growth becomes essential under these methods of potato storage. CIPC [Isopropyl N-(3-chlorophenyl) carbamate] is the most wide spread and commonly used sprout suppressant on potatoes. CIPC has been in use for more than 50 years and research carried out over such a long period use of CIPC has not only enhanced our understanding of its properties and chemistry but also about the production and toxicological status of its metabolites/degradation products. Today, various safety issues and concerns have surfaced primarily due to continuous and long-term use of CIPC. This review presents an appraisal on CIPC and explains the reasons for the long-time dependence on this chemical as a potato sprout suppressant. Issues like maximum residue limit and acceptable daily intake limit are being discussed for CIPC. This article brings an update on practical aspects of potato storage, residue levels of CIPC, efficacy of CIPC as sprout suppressant and health and environmental safety issues linked with CIPC and its metabolites. The aim of this article is to find possible solutions, way outs and future plans that can make the sprout suppression of potatoes safer and more risk free.

Claim: Women need more sleep than men because their brains get more use on a day-to-day basis.
Abstract: Sleep problems and sleep restriction are popular topics of discussion, but few representative data are available. We document Britain's sleep based on a nationally representative sample of 1997, 16-93 year olds, who participated in face-to-face interviews. Fifty-eight per cent of respondents reported sleep problems on one or more nights the previous week and 18% reported that the sleep they obtained was insufficient on the majority of nights. Sleep durations were longest in the youngest participants (16-24 years), who slept on average 1 h longer than the 7.04 (SD 1.55) sample average. Sleep duration showed no appreciable change beyond middle age. Men and women reported sleeping similar amounts but women reported more sleep problems. Men reported sleeping less when there were more children in their household. Workers (i.e. employees) reported sleeping less on workdays than on non-workdays, but those based at home and those not employed did not. Inability to switch off from work was related to sleep duration on non-workdays. Across all participants average sleep duration exhibited a non-monotonic association with quality of life (i.e. contribution of sleep to energy, satisfaction and success in work, home and leisure activities). Quality of life was positively associated with sleep duration, for durations up to 9 h, but negatively associated with quality of life beyond this. Comparison of our data with the US national sleep poll revealed that Britain sleeps as little or less, whereas a comparison with data reported 40 years ago revealed no statistically reliable reductions. Although we may not sleep less than four decades ago, when we report sleeping less we also tend to associate that lack of sleep with poor performance and quality of life.
Question: Does the abstract of the scientific paper support the claim?

","Answer: Step 1: Read the whole abstract and extract information relevant to the question. The abstract discusses the sleep patterns of a representative sample of British individuals aged 16-93 years. It reports that 58% of respondents experienced sleep problems on one or more nights in the previous week, and 18% felt that they did not get enough sleep on most nights. The abstract also notes that sleep duration was longest among the youngest participants and did not change significantly beyond middle age. Men and women reported similar sleep durations, but women reported more sleep problems. Other factors influencing sleep duration included the number of children in the household and employment status. The abstract also discusses the relationship between sleep duration and quality of life.
Step 2: Identify the relevant statement: “Men and women reported sleeping similar amounts but women reported more sleep problems.”
Step 3: Give reasoning to rationalize your decision: The abstract indicates that while women may experience more sleep problems, they do not necessarily sleep more than men. This contradicts the claim that women need more sleep because their brains are used more on a daily basis.
Step 4: Conclusion: The abstract refutes the claim in the scientific news. The rationale in this sentence is: “Men and women reported sleeping similar amounts but women reported more sleep problems.”"

Claim: Updated CDC guidance on monkeypox transmission still includes 'respiratory transmission'.
Abstract: Planning a response to an outbreak of a pandemic strain of influenza is a high public health priority. Three research groups using different individual-based, stochastic simulation models have examined the consequences of intervention strategies chosen in consultation with U.S. public health workers. The first goal is to simulate the effectiveness of a set of potentially feasible intervention strategies. Combinations called targeted layered containment (TLC) of influenza antiviral treatment and prophylaxis and nonpharmaceutical interventions of quarantine, isolation, school closure, community social distancing, and workplace social distancing are considered. The second goal is to examine the robustness of the results to model assumptions. The comparisons focus on a pandemic outbreak in a population similar to that of Chicago, with ?8.6 million people. The simulations suggest that at the expected transmissibility of a pandemic strain, timely implementation of a combination of targeted household antiviral prophylaxis, and social distancing measures could substantially lower the illness attack rate before a highly efficacious vaccine could become available. Timely initiation of measures and school closure play important roles. Because of the current lack of data on which to base such models, further field research is recommended to learn more about the sources of transmission and the effectiveness of social distancing measures in reducing influenza transmission.

Claim: Sun exposure, and diet, causes skin cancers.
Abstract: Melanoma and keratinocyte skin cancer (KSC) are the most common types of cancer in White-skinned populations. Both tumor entities showed increasing incidence rates worldwide but stable or decreasing mortality rates. Rising incidence rates of cutaneous melanoma (CM) and KSC are largely attributed to increasing exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, the main causal risk factor for skin cancer. Incidence rates of KSC, comprising of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), are much higher than that of melanoma. BCC development is mainly the cause of an intensive UV exposure in childhood and adolescence, while SCC development is related to chronic, cumulative UV exposure over decades. Although mortality is relatively low, KSC is an increasing problem for health care services causing significant morbidity. Cutaneous melanoma is rapidly increasing in White populations, with an estimated annual increase of around 3-7% over the past decades. In contrast to SCC, melanoma risk is associated with intermittent and chronic exposure to sunlight. The frequency of its occurrence is closely associated with the constitutive color of the skin and the geographical zone. Changes in outdoor activities and exposure to sunlight during the past 70 years are an important factor for the increasing incidence of melanoma. Mortality rates of melanoma show stabilization in the USA, Australia, and in European countries. In the USA even dropping numbers of death cases were recently reported, probably reflecting efficacy of the new systemic treatments. Among younger cohorts in some populations (e.g., Australia and New Zealand,), stabilizing or declining incidence rates of CM are observed, potentially caused by primary prevention campaigns aimed at reducing UV exposure. In contrast, incidence rates of CM are still rising in most European countries and in the USA. Ongoing trends towards thinner melanoma are largely ascribed to earlier detection.

The benefit of storing the potatoes within the temperature range of 8-12 ¬∞C is minimum accumulation of sugars in stored potato tubers. In sub-temperate, sub-tropical and tropical countries of the world, short-term (3 to 4 months) storage of potatoes is being done by non-refrigerated traditional/on-farm methods. These short- and long-term storage methods keep the stored potatoes suitable not only for table purpose but also for processing. However, once the natural dormancy period of potato is over, the prevailing temperatures in these storage methods favour sprouting and sprout growth. Therefore, use of some sprout suppressant to check the sprout growth becomes essential under these methods of potato storage. CIPC [Isopropyl N-(3-chlorophenyl) carbamate] is the most wide spread and commonly used sprout suppressant on potatoes. CIPC has been in use for more than 50 years and research carried out over such a long period use of CIPC has not only enhanced our understanding of its properties and chemistry but also about the production and toxicological status of its metabolites/degradation products. Today, various safety issues and concerns have surfaced primarily due to continuous and long-term use of CIPC. This review presents an appraisal on CIPC and explains the reasons for the long-time dependence on this chemical as a potato sprout suppressant. Issues like maximum residue limit and acceptable daily intake limit are being discussed for CIPC. This article brings an update on practical aspects of potato storage, residue levels of CIPC, efficacy of CIPC as sprout suppressant and health and environmental safety issues linked with CIPC and its metabolites. The aim of this article is to find possible solutions, way outs and future plans that can make the sprout suppression of potatoes safer and more risk free.

Claim: Wearing masks isn't doing anything to prevent COVID-19.
Abstract: Children with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDDs) and children with medical complexity (CMC) have been disproportionally impacted by the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, including school closures. Children with IDDs and CMC rely on schools for a vast array of educational, therapeutic, medical, and social needs. However, maintaining safe schools for children with IDDs and CMC during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic may be difficult because of the unique challenges of implementing prevention strategies, such as masking, social distancing, and hand hygiene in this high-risk environment. Furthermore, children with IDDs and CMC are at a higher risk of infectious complications and mortality, underscoring the need for effective mitigation strategies. The goal of this report is to describe the implementation of several screening testing models for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in this high-risk population. By describing these models, we hope to identify generalizable and scalable approaches to facilitate safe school operations for children with IDDs and CMC during the current and future pandemics.

Claim: Updated CDC guidance on monkeypox transmission still includes 'respiratory transmission'.
Abstract: Planning a response to an outbreak of a pandemic strain of influenza is a high public health priority. Three research groups using different individual-based, stochastic simulation models have examined the consequences of intervention strategies chosen in consultation with U.S. public health workers. The first goal is to simulate the effectiveness of a set of potentially feasible intervention strategies. Combinations called targeted layered containment (TLC) of influenza antiviral treatment and prophylaxis and nonpharmaceutical interventions of quarantine, isolation, school closure, community social distancing, and workplace social distancing are considered. The second goal is to examine the robustness of the results to model assumptions. The comparisons focus on a pandemic outbreak in a population similar to that of Chicago, with ?8.6 million people. The simulations suggest that at the expected transmissibility of a pandemic strain, timely implementation of a combination of targeted household antiviral prophylaxis, and social distancing measures could substantially lower the illness attack rate before a highly efficacious vaccine could become available. Timely initiation of measures and school closure play important roles. Because of the current lack of data on which to base such models, further field research is recommended to learn more about the sources of transmission and the effectiveness of social distancing measures in reducing influenza transmission.

Claim: Sun exposure, and diet, causes skin cancers.
Abstract: Melanoma and keratinocyte skin cancer (KSC) are the most common types of cancer in White-skinned populations. Both tumor entities showed increasing incidence rates worldwide but stable or decreasing mortality rates. Rising incidence rates of cutaneous melanoma (CM) and KSC are largely attributed to increasing exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, the main causal risk factor for skin cancer. Incidence rates of KSC, comprising of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), are much higher than that of melanoma. BCC development is mainly the cause of an intensive UV exposure in childhood and adolescence, while SCC development is related to chronic, cumulative UV exposure over decades. Although mortality is relatively low, KSC is an increasing problem for health care services causing significant morbidity. Cutaneous melanoma is rapidly increasing in White populations, with an estimated annual increase of around 3-7% over the past decades. In contrast to SCC, melanoma risk is associated with intermittent and chronic exposure to sunlight. The frequency of its occurrence is closely associated with the constitutive color of the skin and the geographical zone. Changes in outdoor activities and exposure to sunlight during the past 70 years are an important factor for the increasing incidence of melanoma. Mortality rates of melanoma show stabilization in the USA, Australia, and in European countries. In the USA even dropping numbers of death cases were recently reported, probably reflecting efficacy of the new systemic treatments. Among younger cohorts in some populations (e.g., Australia and New Zealand,), stabilizing or declining incidence rates of CM are observed, potentially caused by primary prevention campaigns aimed at reducing UV exposure. In contrast, incidence rates of CM are still rising in most European countries and in the USA. Ongoing trends towards thinner melanoma are largely ascribed to earlier detection.

Claim: Targeting cancer cells with resonant frequencies has been shown to 'cure' cancer.
Abstract: In the 1920s and 1930s, Royal Raymond Rife developed special microscopes. Using these he claimed he could visualize living microorganisms, including viruses too small to be seen with any other existing technology, via the color of auras emitted as they vibrated (Citation1). In a 1961 deposition he explained this as follows: A special risley prism which works on a counter rotation principle selects a portion of the light frequency which illuminates these viruses in their own characteristic chemical colors by emission of coordinative light frequency and the viruses become readily identifiable by the colors revealed on observation. (Citation2). Several of his microscopes still exist. Their principles and alleged function have never been validated, and they have never been adopted for use. Rife went on to postulate that the microorganisms he was seeing were involved in human diseases, including cancer (Citation3-6). He invented a machine that he claimed could transmit radio frequency energy into a person and vibrate these microorganisms at a mortal oscillatory rate, thereby killing them and improving the disease they were causing (Citation3-6). Rife's claims were based upon his microscopic evaluations, which again do not appear to be legitimate. The very concept that diseases can be cured by radio frequency energy, originally proposed by Albert Abrams and referred to as 'radionics' (Citation7), was later investigated and disproven by the Scientific American (Citation7,Citation8). Nonetheless, there remain those who believe in Rife's work, claim it was suppressed as part of an elaborate conspiracy (Citation9) and continue to sell similar energy-transmitting devices (Citation10-12). Here, on behalf of PALS who asked about it, we review the potential use of the Rife Machine for ALS.

Claim: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's recent guidance on students and masking lacks a well-grounded scientific justification.
Abstract: In-person schooling has proved contentious and difficult to study throughout the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. Data from a massive online survey in the United States indicate an increased risk of COVID-19-related outcomes among respondents living with a child attending school in person. School-based mitigation measures are associated with significant reductions in risk, particularly daily symptoms screens, teacher masking, and closure of extracurricular activities. A positive association between in-person schooling and COVID-19 outcomes persists at low levels of mitigation, but when seven or more mitigation measures are reported, a significant relationship is no longer observed. Among teachers, working outside the home was associated with an increase in COVID-19-related outcomes, but this association is similar to that observed in other occupations (e.g., health care or office work). Although in-person schooling is associated with household COVID-19 risk, this risk can likely be controlled with properly implemented school-based mitigation measures.

Presenting CBC was as follows: WBC 47.8:Ne 0.3, Ly 0.06, Mo 0.62, Meta 0.01, bands 0.01; Hgb 123; Platelets 55,000. A bone marrow biopsy revealed the following: 70% cellularity with sheets of immature blast-like cells; the lesional cells were CD68 and MPO positive and negative for CD34, CD117, CD138, CD20 and CD3. Flow cytometry revealed 46% of the cells positive for CD33, Cd36, CD64, MY4, CD16, HLA-DR, CD13, CD 56, CD10, CD11b, dim CD4, MPO positive, consistent with acute monocytic leukemia. Cytogenetics were 46, XY [24]. He was given the diagnosis of acute monoblastic leukemia and was started on standard induction chemotherapy: 3 + 7 daunorubicin and ara-C. (doses). Repeat bone marrow biopsy on July 17, 2009 revealed lack of remission. This bone marrow revealed sheets of blast-like cells with 30% residual monoblast population and 4% myeloblast population. He was then treated with high dose cytarabine (3 gm / m2 q day 1, 3, 5) for one cycle. Repeat bone marrow biopsy on Aug 20, 2009 revealed non-remission with 20% residual monoblasts. At this time, it was explained to him that he would be treated in a palliative fashion only. He started low dose AraC at this time and received one 21 day course. He showed hematological recovery by September 2009. Repeat bone marrow biopsy on October 5th, 2009 showed 6% residual myeloblast and 40% monocytic population. Because of previous signals of response at our centre to dandelion root tea/ water extract, and because of his current palliative diagnosis, we mentioned dandelion root tea to him. He started this tea on his own and was followed expectantly. Another bone marrow biopsy at the end of November 2009 showed only residual monocytic population of 10 - 12 % with 79% myeloid cells showing dysplastic features consistent with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia type 2. In March 2010, his platelet count started a gradual decline. By December 29, 2010, the platelet count had dropped to 35,000 √ó 10 9, and a bone marrow biopsy was done to determine etiology. Bone marrow biopsy from January 25, 2011 shows features suggestive chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. This biopsy revealed monocytic cells, as well as occasional promonocytes. There was adequate megakaryoctyes, no Auer rods, no blasts. The monocytes expressed 9% of the total nucleated cells, and did not express CD56. Flow cytometry reported all normal. A diagnosis of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura was made and patient was started on prednisone with subsequent improvement in his platelet count. CBC on July 4, 2011, almost two years from his diagnosis of refractory M5 AML, patient's CBC is almost normal with a white blood count of 7.5 √ó10*9/L, hemoglobin of 122 g/L, platelets of 134 √ó10*9/L, neutrophils of 3.6 √ó 10*9/L, monocytes of 1.65 √ó 10*9/L. His quality of life remains excellent. He continues using dandelion root tea. In view of this very exciting response and the more temporary response seen in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, as well as the exciting findings we have seen in monocytic cells lines and tolerance in animal models, we moving into a phase I/II clinical trial examining the effect of dandelion root extract in patients with monocytic leukemias.
Question: Does the abstract of the scientific paper support the claim?

","Answer: Step 1: Read the whole abstract and extract information relevant to the question. The abstract discusses the case of a 70-year-old man diagnosed with acute monoblastic leukemia. After failing to achieve remission with standard induction chemotherapy and high dose cytarabine, he was treated in a palliative fashion with low dose AraC. The patient then started drinking dandelion root tea on his own. Subsequent bone marrow biopsies showed a decrease in the monocytic population and an increase in myeloid cells with dysplastic features, consistent with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia type 2. The patient's quality of life remained excellent and he continued using dandelion root tea.
Step 2: Identify the relevant statement: “Because of previous signals of response at our centre to dandelion root tea/ water extract, and because of his current palliative diagnosis, we mentioned dandelion root tea to him. He started this tea on his own and was followed expectantly. Another bone marrow biopsy at the end of November 2009 showed only residual monocytic population of 10 - 12 % with 79% myeloid cells showing dysplastic features consistent with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia type 2.""
Step 3: Give reasoning to rationalize your decision: The abstract provides a single case where a patient with leukemia showed some improvement after consuming dandelion root tea. However, it does not provide evidence that dandelion root can kill 98% of cancer cells within 48 hours.
Step 4: Conclusion: The abstract does not support the claim in the scientific news. The rationale in this sentence is: “Because of previous signals of response at our centre to dandelion root tea/ water extract, and because of his current palliative diagnosis, we mentioned dandelion root tea to him. He started this tea on his own and was followed expectantly. Another bone marrow biopsy at the end of November 2009 showed only residual monocytic population of 10 - 12 % with 79% myeloid cells showing dysplastic features consistent with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia type 2."""

Claim: Updated CDC guidance on monkeypox transmission still includes 'respiratory transmission'.
Abstract: Planning a response to an outbreak of a pandemic strain of influenza is a high public health priority. Three research groups using different individual-based, stochastic simulation models have examined the consequences of intervention strategies chosen in consultation with U.S. public health workers. The first goal is to simulate the effectiveness of a set of potentially feasible intervention strategies. Combinations called targeted layered containment (TLC) of influenza antiviral treatment and prophylaxis and nonpharmaceutical interventions of quarantine, isolation, school closure, community social distancing, and workplace social distancing are considered. The second goal is to examine the robustness of the results to model assumptions. The comparisons focus on a pandemic outbreak in a population similar to that of Chicago, with ?8.6 million people. The simulations suggest that at the expected transmissibility of a pandemic strain, timely implementation of a combination of targeted household antiviral prophylaxis, and social distancing measures could substantially lower the illness attack rate before a highly efficacious vaccine could become available. Timely initiation of measures and school closure play important roles. Because of the current lack of data on which to base such models, further field research is recommended to learn more about the sources of transmission and the effectiveness of social distancing measures in reducing influenza transmission.

Claim: Sun exposure, and diet, causes skin cancers.
Abstract: Melanoma and keratinocyte skin cancer (KSC) are the most common types of cancer in White-skinned populations. Both tumor entities showed increasing incidence rates worldwide but stable or decreasing mortality rates. Rising incidence rates of cutaneous melanoma (CM) and KSC are largely attributed to increasing exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, the main causal risk factor for skin cancer. Incidence rates of KSC, comprising of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), are much higher than that of melanoma. BCC development is mainly the cause of an intensive UV exposure in childhood and adolescence, while SCC development is related to chronic, cumulative UV exposure over decades. Although mortality is relatively low, KSC is an increasing problem for health care services causing significant morbidity. Cutaneous melanoma is rapidly increasing in White populations, with an estimated annual increase of around 3-7% over the past decades. In contrast to SCC, melanoma risk is associated with intermittent and chronic exposure to sunlight. The frequency of its occurrence is closely associated with the constitutive color of the skin and the geographical zone. Changes in outdoor activities and exposure to sunlight during the past 70 years are an important factor for the increasing incidence of melanoma. Mortality rates of melanoma show stabilization in the USA, Australia, and in European countries. In the USA even dropping numbers of death cases were recently reported, probably reflecting efficacy of the new systemic treatments. Among younger cohorts in some populations (e.g., Australia and New Zealand,), stabilizing or declining incidence rates of CM are observed, potentially caused by primary prevention campaigns aimed at reducing UV exposure. In contrast, incidence rates of CM are still rising in most European countries and in the USA. Ongoing trends towards thinner melanoma are largely ascribed to earlier detection.
Question: Does the abstract of the scientific paper support the claim?

Answer: Step 1: Read the whole abstract and extract information relevant to the question. The abstract highlights that melanoma and keratinocyte skin cancer (KSC) are the most common types of cancer in White-skinned populations, with increasing incidence rates worldwide but stable or decreasing mortality rates. The rising incidence rates are largely attributed to increasing exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Incidence rates of KSC, comprising basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), are much higher than that of melanoma. Additionally, it discusses the factors contributing to the development of BCC and SCC, as well as the risk factors associated with melanoma. Furthermore, it mentions the trends in mortality rates of melanoma, primary prevention campaigns aimed at reducing UV exposure, and ongoing trends towards thinner melanoma largely ascribed to earlier detection.
Step 2: Identify the relevant statement: “Among younger cohorts in some populations (e.g., Australia and New Zealand), stabilizing or declining incidence rates of CM [cutaneous melanoma] are observed, potentially caused by primary prevention campaigns aimed at reducing UV exposure.""
Step 3: Give reasoning to rationalize your decision: The stabilization or decline in CM rates in younger cohorts is attributed to successful primary prevention campaigns that aim to reduce UV exposure, indicating that targeted public health measures can effectively mitigate the rising trend of melanoma in specific demographics. 
Step 4: Conclusion: The abstract refutes the claim in the scientific news. The rationale in this sentence is: “Among younger cohorts in some populations (e.g., Australia and New Zealand), stabilizing or declining incidence rates of CM [cutaneous melanoma] are observed, potentially caused by primary prevention campaigns aimed at reducing UV exposure.""

Claim: Targeting cancer cells with resonant frequencies has been shown to 'cure' cancer.
Abstract: In the 1920s and 1930s, Royal Raymond Rife developed special microscopes. Using these he claimed he could visualize living microorganisms, including viruses too small to be seen with any other existing technology, via the color of auras emitted as they vibrated (Citation1). In a 1961 deposition he explained this as follows: A special risley prism which works on a counter rotation principle selects a portion of the light frequency which illuminates these viruses in their own characteristic chemical colors by emission of coordinative light frequency and the viruses become readily identifiable by the colors revealed on observation. (Citation2). Several of his microscopes still exist. Their principles and alleged function have never been validated, and they have never been adopted for use. Rife went on to postulate that the microorganisms he was seeing were involved in human diseases, including cancer (Citation3-6). He invented a machine that he claimed could transmit radio frequency energy into a person and vibrate these microorganisms at a mortal oscillatory rate, thereby killing them and improving the disease they were causing (Citation3-6). Rife's claims were based upon his microscopic evaluations, which again do not appear to be legitimate. The very concept that diseases can be cured by radio frequency energy, originally proposed by Albert Abrams and referred to as 'radionics' (Citation7), was later investigated and disproven by the Scientific American (Citation7,Citation8). Nonetheless, there remain those who believe in Rife's work, claim it was suppressed as part of an elaborate conspiracy (Citation9) and continue to sell similar energy-transmitting devices (Citation10-12). Here, on behalf of PALS who asked about it, we review the potential use of the Rife Machine for ALS.

Claim: U.S. carrots are 'soaked' in bleach, chlorpropham is used.
Abstract: World over, potatoes are being stored at 8-12 ¬∞C (85-90 % RH). This is the most common way of long-term (up to 6 to 9 months) storage of potatoes. The benefit of storing the potatoes within the temperature range of 8-12 ¬∞C is minimum accumulation of sugars in stored potato tubers. In sub-temperate, sub-tropical and tropical countries of the world, short-term (3 to 4 months) storage of potatoes is being done by non-refrigerated traditional/on-farm methods. These short- and long-term storage methods keep the stored potatoes suitable not only for table purpose but also for processing. However, once the natural dormancy period of potato is over, the prevailing temperatures in these storage methods favour sprouting and sprout growth. Therefore, use of some sprout suppressant to check the sprout growth becomes essential under these methods of potato storage. CIPC [Isopropyl N-(3-chlorophenyl) carbamate] is the most wide spread and commonly used sprout suppressant on potatoes. CIPC has been in use for more than 50 years and research carried out over such a long period use of CIPC has not only enhanced our understanding of its properties and chemistry but also about the production and toxicological status of its metabolites/degradation products. Today, various safety issues and concerns have surfaced primarily due to continuous and long-term use of CIPC. This review presents an appraisal on CIPC and explains the reasons for the long-time dependence on this chemical as a potato sprout suppressant. Issues like maximum residue limit and acceptable daily intake limit are being discussed for CIPC. This article brings an update on practical aspects of potato storage, residue levels of CIPC, efficacy of CIPC as sprout suppressant and health and environmental safety issues linked with CIPC and its metabolites. The aim of this article is to find possible solutions, way outs and future plans that can make the sprout suppression of potatoes safer and more risk free.

Claim: Covid vaccines cause shingles.
Abstract: Objectives As global vaccination campaigns against COVID-19 disease commence, vaccine safety needs to be closely assessed. The safety profile of mRNA-based vaccines in patients with autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic diseases (AIIRD) is unknown. The objective of this report is to raise awareness of reactivation of herpes zoster (HZ) following the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination in patients with AIIRD. Methods The safety of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination was assessed in an observational study monitoring post-vaccination adverse effects in patients with AIIRD (n?=?491) and controls (n?=?99), conducted in two rheumatology departments in Israel. Results The prevalence of HZ was 1.2% (n?=?6) in patients with AIIRD compared with none in controls. Six female patients aged 49?¬±?11?years with stable AIIRD: RA (n?=?4), Sjogren's syndrome (n?=?1), and undifferentiated connective disease (n?=?1), developed the first in a lifetime event of HZ within a short time after the first vaccine dose in five cases and after the second vaccine dose in one case. In the majority of cases, HZ infection was mild, except a case of HZ ophthalmicus, without corneal involvement, in an RA patient treated with tofacitinib. There were no cases of disseminated HZ disease or postherpetic neuralgia. All but one patient received antiviral treatment with a resolution of HZ-related symptoms up to 6?weeks. Five patients completed the second vaccine dose without other adverse effects. Conclusion Epidemiologic studies on the safety of the mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines in patients with AIIRD are needed to clarify the association between the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination and reactivation of zoster.

Claim: Americans with natural immunity from getting COVID-19 is a very powerful vaccine in itself.
Abstract: Background: Waning immunity occurs in patients who have recovered from Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, it remains unclear whether true re-infection occurs. Methods: Whole genome sequencing was performed directly on respiratory specimens collected during 2 episodes of COVID-19 in a patient. Comparative genome analysis was conducted to differentiate re-infection from persistent viral shedding. Laboratory results, including RT-PCR Ct values and serum Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) IgG, were analyzed. Results: The second episode of asymptomatic infection occurred 142 days after the first symptomatic episode in an apparently immunocompetent patient. During the second episode, there was evidence of acute infection including elevated C-reactive protein and SARS-CoV-2 IgG seroconversion. Viral genomes from first and second episodes belong to different clades/lineages. The virus genome from the first episode contained a a stop codon at position 64 of ORF8, leading to a truncation of 58 amino acids. Another 23 nucleotide and 13 amino acid differences located in 9 different proteins, including positions of B and T cell epitopes, were found between viruses from the first and second episodes. Compared to viral genomes in GISAID, the first virus genome was phylogenetically closely related to strains collected in March/April 2020, while the second virus genome was closely related to strains collected in July/August 2020. Conclusions: Epidemiological, clinical, serological, and genomic analyses confirmed that the patient had re-infection instead of persistent viral shedding from first infection. Our results suggest SARS-CoV-2 may continue to circulate among humans despite herd immunity due to natural infection. Further studies of patients with re-infection will shed light on protective immunological correlates for guiding vaccine design.
Question: Does the abstract of the scientific paper support the claim?

","Answer: Step 1: Read the whole abstract and extract information relevant to the question. The abstract discusses a case of a patient who experienced two episodes of COVID-19 infection. The second episode, which was asymptomatic, occurred 142 days after the first symptomatic episode. The study used whole genome sequencing and comparative genome analysis to differentiate between re-infection and persistent viral shedding. The results showed that the viral genomes from the first and second episodes belonged to different clades/lineages, suggesting that the patient had been re-infected rather than experiencing persistent viral shedding from the first infection. The study concludes that SARS-CoV-2 may continue to circulate among humans despite herd immunity due to natural infection.
Step 2: Identify the relevant statement: “Epidemiological, clinical, serological, and genomic analyses confirmed that the patient had re-infection instead of persistent viral shedding from first infection. Our results suggest SARS-CoV-2 may continue to circulate among humans despite herd immunity due to natural infection.""
Step 3: Give reasoning to rationalize your decision: The abstract provides evidence of a case where a patient was re-infected with COVID-19, suggesting that natural immunity from a previous infection may not provide complete protection against re-infection. This contradicts the claim that natural immunity from getting COVID-19 is a very powerful vaccine in itself.
Step 4: Conclusion: The abstract refutes the claim in the scientific news. The rationale in this sentence is: “Epidemiological, clinical, serological, and genomic analyses confirmed that the patient had re-infection instead of persistent viral shedding from first infection. Our results suggest SARS-CoV-2 may continue to circulate among humans despite herd immunity due to natural infection."""

Claim: Updated CDC guidance on monkeypox transmission still includes 'respiratory transmission'.
Abstract: Planning a response to an outbreak of a pandemic strain of influenza is a high public health priority. Three research groups using different individual-based, stochastic simulation models have examined the consequences of intervention strategies chosen in consultation with U.S. public health workers. The first goal is to simulate the effectiveness of a set of potentially feasible intervention strategies. Combinations called targeted layered containment (TLC) of influenza antiviral treatment and prophylaxis and nonpharmaceutical interventions of quarantine, isolation, school closure, community social distancing, and workplace social distancing are considered. The second goal is to examine the robustness of the results to model assumptions. The comparisons focus on a pandemic outbreak in a population similar to that of Chicago, with ?8.6 million people. The simulations suggest that at the expected transmissibility of a pandemic strain, timely implementation of a combination of targeted household antiviral prophylaxis, and social distancing measures could substantially lower the illness attack rate before a highly efficacious vaccine could become available. Timely initiation of measures and school closure play important roles. Because of the current lack of data on which to base such models, further field research is recommended to learn more about the sources of transmission and the effectiveness of social distancing measures in reducing influenza transmission.

Claim: Sun exposure, and diet, causes skin cancers.
Abstract: Melanoma and keratinocyte skin cancer (KSC) are the most common types of cancer in White-skinned populations. Both tumor entities showed increasing incidence rates worldwide but stable or decreasing mortality rates. Rising incidence rates of cutaneous melanoma (CM) and KSC are largely attributed to increasing exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, the main causal risk factor for skin cancer. Incidence rates of KSC, comprising of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), are much higher than that of melanoma. BCC development is mainly the cause of an intensive UV exposure in childhood and adolescence, while SCC development is related to chronic, cumulative UV exposure over decades. Although mortality is relatively low, KSC is an increasing problem for health care services causing significant morbidity. Cutaneous melanoma is rapidly increasing in White populations, with an estimated annual increase of around 3-7% over the past decades. In contrast to SCC, melanoma risk is associated with intermittent and chronic exposure to sunlight. The frequency of its occurrence is closely associated with the constitutive color of the skin and the geographical zone. Changes in outdoor activities and exposure to sunlight during the past 70 years are an important factor for the increasing incidence of melanoma. Mortality rates of melanoma show stabilization in the USA, Australia, and in European countries. In the USA even dropping numbers of death cases were recently reported, probably reflecting efficacy of the new systemic treatments. Among younger cohorts in some populations (e.g., Australia and New Zealand,), stabilizing or declining incidence rates of CM are observed, potentially caused by primary prevention campaigns aimed at reducing UV exposure. In contrast, incidence rates of CM are still rising in most European countries and in the USA. Ongoing trends towards thinner melanoma are largely ascribed to earlier detection.
Question: Does the abstract of the scientific paper support the claim?

Answer: Step 1: Read the whole abstract and extract information relevant to the question. The abstract highlights that melanoma and keratinocyte skin cancer (KSC) are the most common types of cancer in White-skinned populations, with increasing incidence rates worldwide but stable or decreasing mortality rates. The rising incidence rates are largely attributed to increasing exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Incidence rates of KSC, comprising basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), are much higher than that of melanoma. Additionally, it discusses the factors contributing to the development of BCC and SCC, as well as the risk factors associated with melanoma.

Step 3: Give reasoning to rationalize your decision: The stabilization or decline in CM rates in younger cohorts is attributed to successful primary prevention campaigns that aim to reduce UV exposure, indicating that targeted public health measures can effectively mitigate the rising trend of melanoma in specific demographics. 
Step 4: Conclusion: The abstract refutes the claim in the scientific news. The rationale in this sentence is: “Among younger cohorts in some populations (e.g., Australia and New Zealand), stabilizing or declining incidence rates of CM [cutaneous melanoma] are observed, potentially caused by primary prevention campaigns aimed at reducing UV exposure.""

Claim: Targeting cancer cells with resonant frequencies has been shown to 'cure' cancer.
Abstract: In the 1920s and 1930s, Royal Raymond Rife developed special microscopes. Using these he claimed he could visualize living microorganisms, including viruses too small to be seen with any other existing technology, via the color of auras emitted as they vibrated (Citation1). In a 1961 deposition he explained this as follows: A special risley prism which works on a counter rotation principle selects a portion of the light frequency which illuminates these viruses in their own characteristic chemical colors by emission of coordinative light frequency and the viruses become readily identifiable by the colors revealed on observation. (Citation2). Several of his microscopes still exist. Their principles and alleged function have never been validated, and they have never been adopted for use. Rife went on to postulate that the microorganisms he was seeing were involved in human diseases, including cancer (Citation3-6). He invented a machine that he claimed could transmit radio frequency energy into a person and vibrate these microorganisms at a mortal oscillatory rate, thereby killing them and improving the disease they were causing (Citation3-6). Rife's claims were based upon his microscopic evaluations, which again do not appear to be legitimate. The very concept that diseases can be cured by radio frequency energy, originally proposed by Albert Abrams and referred to as 'radionics' (Citation7), was later investigated and disproven by the Scientific American (Citation7,Citation8). Nonetheless, there remain those who believe in Rife's work, claim it was suppressed as part of an elaborate conspiracy (Citation9) and continue to sell similar energy-transmitting devices (Citation10-12). Here, on behalf of PALS who asked about it, we review the potential use of the Rife Machine for ALS.

Claim: U.S. carrots are 'soaked' in bleach, chlorpropham is used.
Abstract: World over, potatoes are being stored at 8-12 ¬∞C (85-90 % RH). This is the most common way of long-term (up to 6 to 9 months) storage of potatoes. The benefit of storing the potatoes within the temperature range of 8-12 ¬∞C is minimum accumulation of sugars in stored potato tubers. In sub-temperate, sub-tropical and tropical countries of the world, short-term (3 to 4 months) storage of potatoes is being done by non-refrigerated traditional/on-farm methods. These short- and long-term storage methods keep the stored potatoes suitable not only for table purpose but also for processing. However, once the natural dormancy period of potato is over, the prevailing temperatures in these storage methods favour sprouting and sprout growth. Therefore, use of some sprout suppressant to check the sprout growth becomes essential under these methods of potato storage. CIPC [Isopropyl N-(3-chlorophenyl) carbamate] is the most wide spread and commonly used sprout suppressant on potatoes. CIPC has been in use for more than 50 years and research carried out over such a long period use of CIPC has not only enhanced our understanding of its properties and chemistry but also about the production and toxicological status of its metabolites/degradation products. Today, various safety issues and concerns have surfaced primarily due to continuous and long-term use of CIPC. This review presents an appraisal on CIPC and explains the reasons for the long-time dependence on this chemical as a potato sprout suppressant. Issues like maximum residue limit and acceptable daily intake limit are being discussed for CIPC. This article brings an update on practical aspects of potato storage, residue levels of CIPC, efficacy of CIPC as sprout suppressant and health and environmental safety issues linked with CIPC and its metabolites. The aim of this article is to find possible solutions, way outs and future plans that can make the sprout suppression of potatoes safer and more risk free.

Claim: Sleep deprivation is surprisingly effective as an antidepressant.
Abstract: We compared sleep variables in 14 drug-free endogenous depressives and in 14 age- and insomnia-matched, nondepressed controls before and after brief rapid eye movement (REM) sleep deprivation by awakenings. Before REM sleep deprivation, compared with controls, depressives had lower REM latency, higher REM frequency, anda new findingan abnormal temporal distribution of REM sleep. Depression improvement by REM sleep deprivation correlated with the ameliorative effect of brief REM sleep deprivation on one indicator of the abnormal temporal distribution of REM sleep. Several findings suggest that the depressive abnormalities represent a ""damaged,"" weakened sleep cycle ""oscillator"" and its correlate, a circadian rhythm disturbance, and that REM sleep deprivation improved depression to the extent that it stimulated the oscillator and corrected one manifestation of the circadian rhythm disturbance.

Claim: Sugar makes kids hyperactive
Abstract: This study tested the hypothesis that commonly reported negative effects of sugar on children's behavior may be due to parental expectancies. A challenge study design was employed, in which thirty-five 5- to 7-year-old boys reported by their mothers to be behaviorally ""sugar sensitive,"" and their mothers, were randomly assigned to experimental and control groups. In the experimental group, mothers were told their children had received a large dose of sugar, whereas in the control condition mothers were told their sons received a placebo; all children actually received the placebo (aspartame). Mothers and sons were videotaped while interacting together and each mother was then questioned about the interaction. Mothers in the sugar expectancy condition rated their children as significantly more hyperactive. Behavioral observations revealed these mothers exercised more control by maintaining physical closeness, as well as showing trends to criticize, look at, and talk to their sons more than did control mothers. For several variables, the expectancy effect was stronger for cognitively rigid mothers.

Claim: Sun exposure, and diet, causes skin cancers.
Abstract: Melanoma and keratinocyte skin cancer (KSC) are the most common types of cancer in White-skinned populations. Both tumor entities showed increasing incidence rates worldwide but stable or decreasing mortality rates. Rising incidence rates of cutaneous melanoma (CM) and KSC are largely attributed to increasing exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, the main causal risk factor for skin cancer. Incidence rates of KSC, comprising of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), are much higher than that of melanoma. BCC development is mainly the cause of an intensive UV exposure in childhood and adolescence, while SCC development is related to chronic, cumulative UV exposure over decades. Although mortality is relatively low, KSC is an increasing problem for health care services causing significant morbidity. Cutaneous melanoma is rapidly increasing in White populations, with an estimated annual increase of around 3-7% over the past decades. In contrast to SCC, melanoma risk is associated with intermittent and chronic exposure to sunlight. The frequency of its occurrence is closely associated with the constitutive color of the skin and the geographical zone. Changes in outdoor activities and exposure to sunlight during the past 70 years are an important factor for the increasing incidence of melanoma. Mortality rates of melanoma show stabilization in the USA, Australia, and in European countries. In the USA even dropping numbers of death cases were recently reported, probably reflecting efficacy of the new systemic treatments. Among younger cohorts in some populations (e.g., Australia and New Zealand,), stabilizing or declining incidence rates of CM are observed, potentially caused by primary prevention campaigns aimed at reducing UV exposure. In contrast, incidence rates of CM are still rising in most European countries and in the USA. Ongoing trends towards thinner melanoma are largely ascribed to earlier detection.
Question: Does the abstract of the scientific paper support the claim?

Step 4: Conclusion: The abstract refutes the claim in the scientific news. The rationale in this sentence is: “Among younger cohorts in some populations (e.g., Australia and New Zealand), stabilizing or declining incidence rates of CM [cutaneous melanoma] are observed, potentially caused by primary prevention campaigns aimed at reducing UV exposure.""

Claim: Targeting cancer cells with resonant frequencies has been shown to 'cure' cancer.
Abstract: In the 1920s and 1930s, Royal Raymond Rife developed special microscopes. Using these he claimed he could visualize living microorganisms, including viruses too small to be seen with any other existing technology, via the color of auras emitted as they vibrated (Citation1). In a 1961 deposition he explained this as follows: A special risley prism which works on a counter rotation principle selects a portion of the light frequency which illuminates these viruses in their own characteristic chemical colors by emission of coordinative light frequency and the viruses become readily identifiable by the colors revealed on observation. (Citation2). Several of his microscopes still exist. Their principles and alleged function have never been validated, and they have never been adopted for use. Rife went on to postulate that the microorganisms he was seeing were involved in human diseases, including cancer (Citation3-6). He invented a machine that he claimed could transmit radio frequency energy into a person and vibrate these microorganisms at a mortal oscillatory rate, thereby killing them and improving the disease they were causing (Citation3-6). Rife's claims were based upon his microscopic evaluations, which again do not appear to be legitimate. The very concept that diseases can be cured by radio frequency energy, originally proposed by Albert Abrams and referred to as 'radionics' (Citation7), was later investigated and disproven by the Scientific American (Citation7,Citation8). Nonetheless, there remain those who believe in Rife's work, claim it was suppressed as part of an elaborate conspiracy (Citation9) and continue to sell similar energy-transmitting devices (Citation10-12). Here, on behalf of PALS who asked about it, we review the potential use of the Rife Machine for ALS.

Claim: U.S. carrots are 'soaked' in bleach, chlorpropham is used.
Abstract: World over, potatoes are being stored at 8-12 ¬∞C (85-90 % RH). This is the most common way of long-term (up to 6 to 9 months) storage of potatoes. The benefit of storing the potatoes within the temperature range of 8-12 ¬∞C is minimum accumulation of sugars in stored potato tubers. In sub-temperate, sub-tropical and tropical countries of the world, short-term (3 to 4 months) storage of potatoes is being done by non-refrigerated traditional/on-farm methods. These short- and long-term storage methods keep the stored potatoes suitable not only for table purpose but also for processing. However, once the natural dormancy period of potato is over, the prevailing temperatures in these storage methods favour sprouting and sprout growth. Therefore, use of some sprout suppressant to check the sprout growth becomes essential under these methods of potato storage. CIPC [Isopropyl N-(3-chlorophenyl) carbamate] is the most wide spread and commonly used sprout suppressant on potatoes. CIPC has been in use for more than 50 years and research carried out over such a long period use of CIPC has not only enhanced our understanding of its properties and chemistry but also about the production and toxicological status of its metabolites/degradation products. Today, various safety issues and concerns have surfaced primarily due to continuous and long-term use of CIPC. This review presents an appraisal on CIPC and explains the reasons for the long-time dependence on this chemical as a potato sprout suppressant. Issues like maximum residue limit and acceptable daily intake limit are being discussed for CIPC. This article brings an update on practical aspects of potato storage, residue levels of CIPC, efficacy of CIPC as sprout suppressant and health and environmental safety issues linked with CIPC and its metabolites. The aim of this article is to find possible solutions, way outs and future plans that can make the sprout suppression of potatoes safer and more risk free.

Claim: Weather is a serious risk factor for heart failure.
Abstract: The authors' purpose in this study was to determine whether changes in weather conditions were associated with daily mortality among people aged 65 years and older diagnosed as having congestive heart failure in Montreal, Canada, and who died in the urban area between 1984 and 1993. The authors used a time-stratified case-crossover design and adjusted the models for nitrogen dioxide and ozone. They found a strong nonlinear association with maximum temperature in the warmer months of the year, with a threshold at about 25¬∞C. The authors observed no associations after lag 3 days. In the cold period, they found that risks increased linearly with increasingly colder temperatures, but only after lag 2 days. The authors found no associations with relative humidity. For change in barometric pressure from the previous day, they found no associations in the cold period, but an increase in pressure from the previous day increased risk for lags 0 or 1 days. The authors found some differences between men and women.

Claim: Updated CDC guidance on monkeypox transmission still includes 'respiratory transmission'.
Abstract: Planning a response to an outbreak of a pandemic strain of influenza is a high public health priority. Three research groups using different individual-based, stochastic simulation models have examined the consequences of intervention strategies chosen in consultation with U.S. public health workers. The first goal is to simulate the effectiveness of a set of potentially feasible intervention strategies. Combinations called targeted layered containment (TLC) of influenza antiviral treatment and prophylaxis and nonpharmaceutical interventions of quarantine, isolation, school closure, community social distancing, and workplace social distancing are considered. The second goal is to examine the robustness of the results to model assumptions. The comparisons focus on a pandemic outbreak in a population similar to that of Chicago, with ?8.6 million people. The simulations suggest that at the expected transmissibility of a pandemic strain, timely implementation of a combination of targeted household antiviral prophylaxis, and social distancing measures could substantially lower the illness attack rate before a highly efficacious vaccine could become available. Timely initiation of measures and school closure play important roles. Because of the current lack of data on which to base such models, further field research is recommended to learn more about the sources of transmission and the effectiveness of social distancing measures in reducing influenza transmission.

Claim: Ancient Chinese ink could hold a surprising new way to kill cancer cells.
Abstract: Finding a simple and effective strategy to eliminate tumor metastatic lymph nodes is highly desired in clinical tumor treatment. Herein, we reported a Chinese traditional ink (Hu-ink)-based treatment for photothermal therapy (PTT) of tumor metastatic lymph nodes. By simple dilution, stable Chinese traditional ink dispersion was obtained, which presents excellent photothermal effect because of its high absorption in near-infrared (NIR) region. Meanwhile, as revealed by staining and photoacoustic imaging, Hu-ink could transfer to nearby lymph nodes after directly injected into the primary tumors. Under the guidance of dual-modality mapping, the metastatic sentinel lymph nodes could be subsequently eliminated by NIR irradiation. The good biocompatibility of Hu-ink has also been verified by a series of experiments. Therefore, the Hu-ink-based treatment exhibits great potential for PTT of tumor metastatic lymph nodes in future clinical practice.

Claim: Targeting cancer cells with resonant frequencies has been shown to 'cure' cancer.
Abstract: In the 1920s and 1930s, Royal Raymond Rife developed special microscopes. Using these he claimed he could visualize living microorganisms, including viruses too small to be seen with any other existing technology, via the color of auras emitted as they vibrated (Citation1). In a 1961 deposition he explained this as follows: A special risley prism which works on a counter rotation principle selects a portion of the light frequency which illuminates these viruses in their own characteristic chemical colors by emission of coordinative light frequency and the viruses become readily identifiable by the colors revealed on observation. (Citation2). Several of his microscopes still exist. Their principles and alleged function have never been validated, and they have never been adopted for use. Rife went on to postulate that the microorganisms he was seeing were involved in human diseases, including cancer (Citation3-6). He invented a machine that he claimed could transmit radio frequency energy into a person and vibrate these microorganisms at a mortal oscillatory rate, thereby killing them and improving the disease they were causing (Citation3-6). Rife's claims were based upon his microscopic evaluations, which again do not appear to be legitimate. The very concept that diseases can be cured by radio frequency energy, originally proposed by Albert Abrams and referred to as 'radionics' (Citation7), was later investigated and disproven by the Scientific American (Citation7,Citation8). Nonetheless, there remain those who believe in Rife's work, claim it was suppressed as part of an elaborate conspiracy (Citation9) and continue to sell similar energy-transmitting devices (Citation10-12). Here, on behalf of PALS who asked about it, we review the potential use of the Rife Machine for ALS.

Claim: U.S. carrots are 'soaked' in bleach, chlorpropham is used.
Abstract: World over, potatoes are being stored at 8-12 ¬∞C (85-90 % RH). This is the most common way of long-term (up to 6 to 9 months) storage of potatoes. The benefit of storing the potatoes within the temperature range of 8-12 ¬∞C is minimum accumulation of sugars in stored potato tubers. In sub-temperate, sub-tropical and tropical countries of the world, short-term (3 to 4 months) storage of potatoes is being done by non-refrigerated traditional/on-farm methods. These short- and long-term storage methods keep the stored potatoes suitable not only for table purpose but also for processing. However, once the natural dormancy period of potato is over, the prevailing temperatures in these storage methods favour sprouting and sprout growth. Therefore, use of some sprout suppressant to check the sprout growth becomes essential under these methods of potato storage. CIPC [Isopropyl N-(3-chlorophenyl) carbamate] is the most wide spread and commonly used sprout suppressant on potatoes. CIPC has been in use for more than 50 years and research carried out over such a long period use of CIPC has not only enhanced our understanding of its properties and chemistry but also about the production and toxicological status of its metabolites/degradation products. Today, various safety issues and concerns have surfaced primarily due to continuous and long-term use of CIPC. This review presents an appraisal on CIPC and explains the reasons for the long-time dependence on this chemical as a potato sprout suppressant. Issues like maximum residue limit and acceptable daily intake limit are being discussed for CIPC. This article brings an update on practical aspects of potato storage, residue levels of CIPC, efficacy of CIPC as sprout suppressant and health and environmental safety issues linked with CIPC and its metabolites. The aim of this article is to find possible solutions, way outs and future plans that can make the sprout suppression of potatoes safer and more risk free.

Claim: Parkinson's is linked to gut bacteria.
Abstract: There is mounting evidence for a connection between the gut and Parkinson's disease (PD). Dysbiosis of gut microbiota could explain several features of PD. The objective of this study was to determine if PD involves dysbiosis of gut microbiome, disentangle effects of confounders, and identify candidate taxa and functional pathways to guide research. A total of 197 PD cases and 130 controls were studied. Microbial composition was determined by 16S rRNA gene sequencing of DNA extracted from stool. Metadata were collected on 39 potential confounders including medications, diet, gastrointestinal symptoms, and demographics. Statistical analyses were conducted while controlling for potential confounders and correcting for multiple testing. We tested differences in the overall microbial composition, taxa abundance, and functional pathways. Independent microbial signatures were detected for PD (P = 4E-5), participants' region of residence within the United States (P = 3E-3), age (P = 0.03), sex (P = 1E-3), and dietary fruits/vegetables (P = 0.01). Among patients, independent signals were detected for catechol-O-methyltransferase-inhibitors (P = 4E-4), anticholinergics (P = 5E-3), and possibly carbidopa/levodopa (P = 0.05). We found significantly altered abundances of the Bifidobacteriaceae, Christensenellaceae, [Tissierellaceae], Lachnospiraceae, Lactobacillaceae, Pasteurellaceae, and Verrucomicrobiaceae families. Functional predictions revealed changes in numerous pathways, including the metabolism of plant-derived compounds and xenobiotics degradation. PD is accompanied by dysbiosis of gut microbiome. Results coalesce divergent findings of prior studies, reveal altered abundance of several taxa, nominate functional pathways, and demonstrate independent effects of PD medications on the microbiome. The findings provide new leads and testable hypotheses on the pathophysiology and treatment of PD.

Claim: Updated CDC guidance on monkeypox transmission still includes 'respiratory transmission'.
Abstract: Planning a response to an outbreak of a pandemic strain of influenza is a high public health priority. Three research groups using different individual-based, stochastic simulation models have examined the consequences of intervention strategies chosen in consultation with U.S. public health workers. The first goal is to simulate the effectiveness of a set of potentially feasible intervention strategies. Combinations called targeted layered containment (TLC) of influenza antiviral treatment and prophylaxis and nonpharmaceutical interventions of quarantine, isolation, school closure, community social distancing, and workplace social distancing are considered. The second goal is to examine the robustness of the results to model assumptions. The comparisons focus on a pandemic outbreak in a population similar to that of Chicago, with ?8.6 million people. The simulations suggest that at the expected transmissibility of a pandemic strain, timely implementation of a combination of targeted household antiviral prophylaxis, and social distancing measures could substantially lower the illness attack rate before a highly efficacious vaccine could become available. Timely initiation of measures and school closure play important roles. Because of the current lack of data on which to base such models, further field research is recommended to learn more about the sources of transmission and the effectiveness of social distancing measures in reducing influenza transmission.

Claim: Sun exposure, and diet, causes skin cancers.
Abstract: Melanoma and keratinocyte skin cancer (KSC) are the most common types of cancer in White-skinned populations. Both tumor entities showed increasing incidence rates worldwide but stable or decreasing mortality rates. Rising incidence rates of cutaneous melanoma (CM) and KSC are largely attributed to increasing exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, the main causal risk factor for skin cancer. Incidence rates of KSC, comprising of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), are much higher than that of melanoma. BCC development is mainly the cause of an intensive UV exposure in childhood and adolescence, while SCC development is related to chronic, cumulative UV exposure over decades. Although mortality is relatively low, KSC is an increasing problem for health care services causing significant morbidity. Cutaneous melanoma is rapidly increasing in White populations, with an estimated annual increase of around 3-7% over the past decades. In contrast to SCC, melanoma risk is associated with intermittent and chronic exposure to sunlight. The frequency of its occurrence is closely associated with the constitutive color of the skin and the geographical zone. Changes in outdoor activities and exposure to sunlight during the past 70 years are an important factor for the increasing incidence of melanoma. Mortality rates of melanoma show stabilization in the USA, Australia, and in European countries. In the USA even dropping numbers of death cases were recently reported, probably reflecting efficacy of the new systemic treatments. Among younger cohorts in some populations (e.g., Australia and New Zealand,), stabilizing or declining incidence rates of CM are observed, potentially caused by primary prevention campaigns aimed at reducing UV exposure. In contrast, incidence rates of CM are still rising in most European countries and in the USA. Ongoing trends towards thinner melanoma are largely ascribed to earlier detection.

Claim: AI can analyze mammogram results 30 times faster than doctors and with 99% accuracy.
Abstract: A key challenge to mining electronic health records for mammography research is the preponderance of unstructured narrative text, which strikingly limits usable output. The imaging characteristics of breast cancer subtypes have been described previously, but without standardization of parameters for data mining. The authors searched the enterprise-wide data warehouse at the Houston Methodist Hospital, the Methodist Environment for Translational Enhancement and Outcomes Research (METEOR), for patients with Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) category 5 mammogram readings performed between January 2006 and May 2015 and an available pathology report. The authors developed natural language processing (NLP) software algorithms to automatically extract mammographic and pathologic findings from free text mammogram and pathology reports. The correlation between mammographic imaging features and breast cancer subtype was analyzed using one-way analysis of variance and the Fisher exact test. The NLP algorithm was able to obtain key characteristics for 543 patients who met the inclusion criteria. Patients with estrogen receptor-positive tumors were more likely to have spiculated margins (P?=?.0008), and those with tumors that overexpressed human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) were more likely to have heterogeneous and pleomorphic calcifications (P?=?.0078 and P?=?.0002, respectively). Mammographic imaging characteristics, obtained from an automated text search and the extraction of mammogram reports using NLP techniques, correlated with pathologic breast cancer subtype. The results of the current study validate previously reported trends assessed by manual data collection. Furthermore, NLP provides an automated means with which to scale up data extraction and analysis for clinical decision support.

Rife proposed that the microorganisms he observed were involved in human diseases, such as cancer, and invented a machine that he claimed could transmit radio frequency energy to kill these microorganisms and improve the associated diseases. However, Rife's claims and the concept of curing diseases with radio frequency energy have not been validated and were later disproven. Despite this, there are still people who believe in Rife's work and sell similar energy-transmitting devices.
Step 2: Identify the relevant statement: “The very concept that diseases can be cured by radio frequency energy, originally proposed by Albert Abrams and referred to as 'radionics' (Citation7), was later investigated and disproven by the Scientific American (Citation7,Citation8).”
Step 3: Give reasoning to rationalize your decision: Radionics has previously been investigated and disproved in research conducted by Scientific American and thereby cannot cure cancer. 
Step 4: Conclusion: The abstract refutes the claim in the news. The rationale is this sentence: “The very concept that diseases… disproven by the Scientific American (Citation7,Citation8).”

Claim: U.S. carrots are 'soaked' in bleach, chlorpropham is used.
Abstract: World over, potatoes are being stored at 8-12 ¬∞C (85-90 % RH). This is the most common way of long-term (up to 6 to 9 months) storage of potatoes. The benefit of storing the potatoes within the temperature range of 8-12 ¬∞C is minimum accumulation of sugars in stored potato tubers. In sub-temperate, sub-tropical and tropical countries of the world, short-term (3 to 4 months) storage of potatoes is being done by non-refrigerated traditional/on-farm methods. These short- and long-term storage methods keep the stored potatoes suitable not only for table purpose but also for processing. However, once the natural dormancy period of potato is over, the prevailing temperatures in these storage methods favour sprouting and sprout growth. Therefore, use of some sprout suppressant to check the sprout growth becomes essential under these methods of potato storage. CIPC [Isopropyl N-(3-chlorophenyl) carbamate] is the most wide spread and commonly used sprout suppressant on potatoes. CIPC has been in use for more than 50 years and research carried out over such a long period use of CIPC has not only enhanced our understanding of its properties and chemistry but also about the production and toxicological status of its metabolites/degradation products. Today, various safety issues and concerns have surfaced primarily due to continuous and long-term use of CIPC. This review presents an appraisal on CIPC and explains the reasons for the long-time dependence on this chemical as a potato sprout suppressant. Issues like maximum residue limit and acceptable daily intake limit are being discussed for CIPC. This article brings an update on practical aspects of potato storage, residue levels of CIPC, efficacy of CIPC as sprout suppressant and health and environmental safety issues linked with CIPC and its metabolites. The aim of this article is to find possible solutions, way outs and future plans that can make the sprout suppression of potatoes safer and more risk free.
Question: Does the abstract of the scientific paper support the claim?

Answer: Step 1: Read the whole abstract and extract information relevant to the question. The abstract discusses the storage of potatoes at 8-12 ¬∞C with 85-90% RH for long-term storage. It explains that potatoes are stored using traditional methods in sub-temperate, sub-tropical, and tropical countries for short-term storage. It also emphasizes the use of the sprout suppressant CIPC and raises concerns about its long-term and continuous use, including safety issues and environmental impact. The article aims to find safer and more risk-free solutions for the sprout suppression of potatoes.
Step 2: Identify the relevant statement: CIPC [Isopropyl N-(3-chlorophenyl) carbamate] is the most widespread and commonly used sprout suppressant on potatoes. CIPC has been in use for more than 50 years and research carried out over such a long period of use of CIPC has not only enhanced our understanding of its properties and chemistry but also about the production and toxicological status of its metabolites/degradation products.”
Step 3: Give reasoning to rationalize your decision: The abstract addresses the use of chlorpropham, indicating it is a widespread sprout suppressant specifically for potatoes, not carrots.
Step 4: Conclusion: The abstract refutes the claim in the scientific news. The rationale in this sentence is: “CIPC [Isopropyl N-(3-chlorophenyl) carbamate] is the most wide spread and commonly used sprout suppressant on potatoes. CIPC has been in use for more than 50 years and research carried out over such a long period use of CIPC has not only enhanced our understanding of its properties and chemistry but also about the production and toxicological status of its metabolites/degradation products.”

Claim: Ovarian cancer can be detected in your breath.
Abstract: Flexible sensors based on molecularly modified gold nanoparticles (GNPs) were integrated into a dynamic cross-reactive diagnostic sensing array. Each bending state of the GNP-based flexible sensor gives unique nanoparticle spatial organization, altering the interaction between GNP ligands and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which increases the amount of data obtainable from each sensor. Individual dynamic flexible sensor could selectively detect parts per billion (ppb) level VOCs that are linked with ovarian cancers in exhaled breath and discriminate them from environmental VOCs that exist in exhaled breath samples, but do not relate to ovarian cancer per se. Strain-related response successfully discriminated between exhaled breath collected from control subjects and those with ovarian cancer, with data from a single sensor being sufficient to obtain 82% accuracy, irrespective of important confounding factors, such as tobacco consumption and comorbidities. The approach raises the hope of achieving an extremely simple, inexpensive, portable, and noninvasive diagnostic procedure for cancer and other diseases.
Question: Does the abstract of the scientific paper support the claim?

","Answer: Step 1: Read the whole abstract and extract information relevant to the question. The abstract discusses the development of flexible sensors based on molecularly modified gold nanoparticles (GNPs). These sensors can detect volatile organic compounds (VOCs) linked with ovarian cancers in exhaled breath at parts per billion (ppb) levels. The sensors can discriminate these VOCs from environmental VOCs that exist in exhaled breath samples but are not related to ovarian cancer. The data from a single sensor can discriminate between breath samples from control subjects and those with ovarian cancer with 82% accuracy, regardless of confounding factors like tobacco consumption and comorbidities.
Step 2: Identify the relevant statement: “Individual dynamic flexible sensor could selectively detect parts per billion (ppb) level VOCs that are linked with ovarian cancers in exhaled breath and discriminate them from environmental VOCs that exist in exhaled breath samples, but do not relate to ovarian cancer per se.”
Step 3: Give reasoning to rationalize your decision: The abstract clearly states that the developed sensor can detect VOCs linked with ovarian cancer in exhaled breath, supporting the claim that ovarian cancer can be detected in breath.
Step 4: Conclusion: The abstract supports the claim in the scientific news. The rationale in this sentence is: “Individual dynamic flexible sensor could selectively detect parts per billion (ppb) level VOCs that are linked with ovarian cancers in exhaled breath and discriminate them from environmental VOCs that exist in exhaled breath samples, but do not relate to ovarian cancer per se.”"
