We report the discovery of a new optofluidic principle and demonstrate the generation of a steady-state water flow by a pulsed laser beam through a glass window. To generate a flow or stream in the same path as the refracted laser beam in pure water from an arbitrary spot on the window, we first fill a glass cuvette with an aqueous solution of Au nanoparticles. A flow will emerge from the focused laser spot on the window after the laser is turned on for a few to tens of minutes; the flow remains after the colloidal solution is completely replaced by pure water. Microscopically, this transformation is made possible by an underlying plasmonic nanoparticle-decorated cavity, which is self-fabricated on the glass by nanoparticle-assisted laser etching and exhibits size and shape uniquely tailored to the incident beam profile. Hydrophone signals indicate that the flow is driven via acoustic streaming by a long-lasting ultrasound wave that is resonantly generated by the laser and the cavity through the photoacoustic effect. The principle of this light-driven flow via ultrasound, that is, photoacoustic streaming by coupling photoacoustics to acoustic streaming, is general and can be applied to any liquid, opening up new research and applications in optofluidics as well as traditional photoacoustics and acoustic streaming.","Claim: It's possible for lasers to transfer its momentum to create a stream of liquid.

In addition, some smartphone attacks are based on physical access to the phone like smudge attacks. All these have reminded current users to pay more attention for smartphone security such as installing anti-malware software to defend against malicious apps, which may reduce the effectiveness of most malware.

The efficiency of our designed attacks relies on the observations that users are not aware of any risk when charging their phones in public places and that most users would interact with their phone during the charging. Different from other malware and attacks, our designed juice filming attacks possess six major features: 1) be simple but quite efficient; 2) user unawareness; 3) does not need to install any apps on phone's side; 4) does not need to ask for any permissions; 5) cannot be detected by any current anti-malware software; 6) can be scalable and effective in both Android OS and iOS.
