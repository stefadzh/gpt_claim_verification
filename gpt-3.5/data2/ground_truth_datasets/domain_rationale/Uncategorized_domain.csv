Abstract:
0. Hemostasis is a key biological feature that prevents sustained bleeding upon injury.1 Acute thrombosis, a leading cause of mortalities and morbidities worldwide, is a pathological hemostatic condition, which is mainly caused by the rupture of an unstable atherosclerotic plaque leading to myocardial infarction or stroke.1, 2 These unwanted intravascular blood thrombi cause vascular occlusions and organ damage due to prolonged lack of oxygen.
1. [1] As a first line of defense, fast-acting thrombolytic drugs, such as plasminogen activators (PAs), are administered to stop thrombus growth and to quickly induce thrombus deconstruction.3 However, systemic (intravenous) or local (catheter) delivery of PAs is deemed neither effective nor safe due to either rapid neutralization by their antidotes (e.g., plasminogen activator inhibitor) or bleeding complications that may lead to intracranial hemorrhages.1 With no safe thrombolytic treatments currently available and a lack of timely treatments, acute thrombosis remains a major healthcare issue contributing to a significant number of deaths and disabilities.
