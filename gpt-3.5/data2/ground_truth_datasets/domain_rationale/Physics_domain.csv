4. Photoluminescence and absorption spectra collected from single crystals of Bk(IO3)4 show evidence for doping with BkIII in these crystals.
5. In addition to luminescence from BkIII in the Bk(IO3)4 crystals, a broad-band absorption feature is initially present that is similar to features observed in systems with intervalence charge transfer.
6. However, the high-specific activity of 249Bk (t1/2 = 320 d) causes oxidation of BkIII and only BkIV is present after a few days with concomitant loss of both the BkIII luminescence and the broadband feature.
7. The electronic structure of Bk(IO3)3 and Bk(IO3)4 were examined using a range of computational methods that include density functional theory both on clusters and on periodic structures, relativistic ab initio wave function calculations that incorporate spin–orbit coupling (CASSCF), and by a full-model Hamiltonian with spin–orbit coupling and Slater–Condon parameters (CONDON).

They are stable as crystals because of charge compensating cations; while in solutions, solvent molecules protect them. However, they are rarely stable in the gas phase because of strong electrostatic repulsion between the extra electrons. Therefore, understanding their stability without the influence of the environment has been of great interest to scientists for decades. While much of the past work has focused on dianions, work on triply charged negative ions is sparse and the search for the smallest trianion that is stable against spontaneous electron emission or fragmentation continues. Stability of BeB11(X)123? (X=CN, SCN, BO) trianions is demonstrated in the gas phase, with BeB11(CN)123? exhibiting colossal stability against electron emission by 2.65?eV and against its neutral adduct by 15.85?eV. The unusual stability of these trianions opens the door to a new class of super-pnictogens with potential applications in aluminum-ion batteries.","Claim: Scientists have discovered the existence of a type of particle that's never previously been observed, which demonstrates unprecedented chemical stability.

A central issue in developing such artificial materials is to understand and control the interlayer electron transfer process, which plays a key role in harnessing their emergent properties. Recent photoluminescence and transient absorption measurements revealed that the electron transfer in heterobilayers occurs on ultrafast time scales. However, there is still a lack of fundamental understanding on how this process can be so efficient at van der Waals interfaces. Here we show evidence suggesting the coherent nature of such interlayer electron transfer. In a trilayer of MoS2-WS2-MoSe2, electrons excited in MoSe2 transfer to MoS2 in about one picosecond. Surprisingly, these electrons do not populate the middle WS2 layer during this process.
